*2. more raw documents (no response from dima => email dafna)
*6. identify where clustering doesn't agree with me, and why
4. Presentation

1) very clear motivation:
- point of view. what does it mean?
2) problem we're trying to sovle:
3) how you define controversy score
4) vectors representations, clustering
5) demo
6) current challenges
- lda
- sentiment analysis
- examples
7) future work

5. email the story to Dafna by Tuesday

1. normalization consisderation
3. more complex sentiment analysis











// Clusteering
1. clustering: k-means (k = 2). represent each doc as a vector of sentment scores for each controeversial word.
// LDA
2. Ask Dima -> get the token_id, number of occurrences, ... (raw counts!!)
3. 3~5 topics
4. graph. node for each word. weight: how many topics they share (SCC? semi cliques)
