Hey James -

Query server is now running at ilws19.stanford.edu:8081.

The purpose is to give you articles and bag of words with tfidf scores associated with each article. To run a query "dafna" in the time month range starting on June 1, 2013, the syntax is to simply request:

ilws19.stanford.edu:8081/<query>/<date_request>
ex.
ilws19.stanford.edu:8081/dafna/M06012013

Query is one or more words separated by "_"
Date_request is a string formatted as follows: 
[Range Char: one of {M,T,P,W}][Start date (if Range char is not P) written as MMDDYYYY]
M - means month
T - means three months
P - means past week
W - means week

examples:
ilws19.stanford.edu:8081/dafna/M06012013
ilws19.stanford.edu:8081/james_is_awesome/W06132013
ilws19.stanford.edu:8081/do_work/P

Output is json with "result": "output_dir"
output_dir contains ten files, representing time slices and their documents. Each file is formatted as described in the documentation: article metadata + stemid and their tf-idf. 

I might launch a separate service that does translation of the stemids to representative stems, but that's a little lower on my todo list. I can be pressured to bump it higher if you need!

Also, would you prefer to have more json output in addition to the result directory? If so, write some requests.

Also, keep an eye out: I requested that Andrej moves the query server to the public facing server, so you don't have to be on the Stanford sub net to access it.

Hope all is well,
Dima

http://snap-sentiment.stanford.edu/ is configured. It redirects to
http://rambo.stanford.edu:8010 where your server is/was running.

So far I have not made it into a service just so it is easier to
restart and you can run it an tweak it as you want. The reason it is
not running now is because I changed the ownership of the files to
your account. That will enable you to run the server yourself.

If you ssh into rambo.stanford.edu (note that this only works from
Stanford networks, if you are outside of Stanford ssh into
whale.stanford.edu first) you will find the code here:

/lfs/local/0/snap-sentiment

It's basically a clone of your git repository. I added some
sys.path.append() statements with relevant directories to run.py and
manage.py. I also tweaked a few things in sentiment/settings.py. I
have not pushed this back to your repository so you might want to
check those changes out first.

Running the code is similar to running on your notebook:

python2.7 run.py

I suggest starting a screen session and then running the command inside of it.

Let me know if you need anything else or run into problems.
