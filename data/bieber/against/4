Bieber calls Clinton after using the F-word.
Justin Bieber called and apologized to former President Bill Clinton after a recently-emerged video showed the artist spraying cleaner fluid on a photo of the former president and saying "F*** Bill Clinton."

An aide to Clinton confirmed the apology, and Bieber tweeted about the conversation Wednesday night.
@billclinton thanks for taking the time to talk Mr. President. Your words meant alot. #greatguy
The video, posted online by TMZ, showed Bieber urinating in a janatorial mop bucket as he and his entourage exited a nightclub through a restauraunt kitchen.

The poorly-shot video then shows Bieber using what looks like cleaning liquid to spray a poster of Clinton as the performer shouts the expletive about the former president. The incident reportedly happened in New York City earlier this year.

E! Online reported that Bieber told Clinton he would love to help the Clinton Global Initiative, a public health and humanitarian organization run by the former president and his family.

Clinton reportedly told Bieber, "If that is the worst thing you have ever done, all is well."
