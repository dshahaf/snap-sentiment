Mario Batali on Justin Bieber urination incident: "I would have brutally kicked his ass"
Coming up this evening at 9, "Piers Morgan Live" sets the table with another fascinating – and in many way delicious – edition of "Guest Host Week," as celebrity chef and television personality Anthony Bourdain writes his own menu, and as always, candor and humor are the specials of the day.

Joined by his colleagues, fellow chef's Eric Ripert and Mario Batali, the dinner conversation turns to, of all things, "The Biebs":

"One of my favorite artists, Justin Bieber, was filmed recently going through the kitchen of an operating nightclub, a busy kitchen, and apparently chose to relieve himself into a mop bucket in the actual kitchen itself in front of the kitchen staff. More to the point, [he] left a mess for, you know, the night clean-up guy, the morning dishwasher," explained the host of "Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown." "Surely you don’t approve of this sort of behavior. What would be the appropriate response, were you the chef at this establishment and young Justin Bieber decided to stop in your kitchen to relieve himself and syphon the python into the mop bucket. How would you respond?"

Holding little back, Batali suggested a slight serving of physicality might be in order:

"I would have brutally kicked his ass. I mean, that’s not just being funny and flip that’s actually peeing on somebody’s workplace," said the American chef, writer, and restauranteur. "That’s odd, that’s weird, that’s just…I mean I think he just needs a wakeup call. I don’t think he’s an evil kid."

Seated directly to Batali's left, Ripert wrote off Bieber antics as simply the result of youth and ignorance:

"He was drunk and stupid," said the French chef.

Watch the clip further to see Bourdain finish the sentence "no matter how drunk and stupid I’ve ever been," and then tune in at 9 for the full episode of "PIers Morgan Live" hosted by Anthony Bourdain.
