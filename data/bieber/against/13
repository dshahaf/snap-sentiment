Lance Bass on Justin Bieber: "With fame comes entitlement ... it's hard to keep that ego in check"
On the backdrop of what's been a headline-grabbing start to 2013 for music icon Justin Bieber, this evening "Piers Morgan Live" invites Lance Bass to offer his inside perspective into a life lived largely in the public eye.

Having reached super stardom as one-fifth of the world-famous boy band 'N Sync, Bass relates to what Bieber deals with, but admits the situations aren't identical:

"It is different, I was with a group, so I had four of my best friends with me to keep me down to earth," says the 33-year-old host of XM's "Dirty Pop." "When you're a solo artist, no one's there telling you 'No.' And I think that's the biggest problem, especially with teen idols, you immediately go from learning about puberty, to having hundreds of employees, and not really knowing how to deal with that."

During a record-setting seven year existence, Bass and 'N Sync sold more than 50 million albums, and excited fans across the world. As the guest notes, that type of success brings about a unique set of challenges:

"With fame comes entitlement. You have tons of people around you saying 'Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir.' So' it's hard to keep that ego in check," he tells Piers Morgan. "He's [Bieber] sought after all over the world, and that can get to you. That's got to affect someone at that age."

Watch the clip, and listen to the exchange, then tune in at 9 as Bass goes on to detail some of the specific issues that arise when young people garner the type of attention currently being paid to Justin Bieber.
