Kim Kardashian: Bieber's got swag
Call it teen boy swag if you must, but whatever it is, Justin Bieber’s got it – or so says Kim Kardashian.

The 29-year-old reality TV star attracted negative attention from Fox News host Bill O’Reilly because she posed in a saucy photo shoot with 16-year-old Bieber for Elle magazine. "The theme was 'The Graduate, for obvious reasons,” Kardashian joked on her blog.

And while both of the stars have said that they’re just friends, Kardashian has said she might take a second look at the Biebs if he was already 18.


“I asked if you would date him if he was 18, and you said absolutely,” George Lopez said to Kardashian Tuesday night on his TBS talk show.

Kardashian, who recently ended a relationship with pro athlete Reggie Bush, carefully responded, “If he was of legal age.” Here’s the thing about Biebs, she added: “Justin Bieber, he has this swag to him; you have to meet him. He has this swag.”

She then dismissed O’Reilly’s commentary, telling Lopez that the frolicking on the Elle shoot was nothing short of wholesome.

“The shoot was all in fun. We had a good time. Everyone’s entitled to their own opinion on it,” she said. “We were just having a good time.”

As for Bieber, he's already agreed that the shoot was a great time. "She's really beautiful so that was ... I mean, any 16-year-old would want to do a photo shoot with her," he told Access Hollywood. To top it off, he went on, "Beyond just being, like, extremely hot, she's actually, you know, a really nice person."
