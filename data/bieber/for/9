Justin Bieber writes mom a song for Mother's Day.
Justin Bieber's latest single has one special lady in mind: His mom.

Biebs' new song, called "Turn to You," released at midnight on Friday, just in time for Mother's Day:
"You worked two jobs to keep a roof up over our heads/You chose a life for  me, no you never gave up/I admire you for the strength you've instilled in me," Bieber sings to his mom, Pattie Mallette.


Bieber recently told MTV that "Turn to You" highlights the difficulties his mom faced raising the 18-year-old pop star "at, like, the age I am now," he said. "[It's about] just the struggles she went through and how brave she was, and I think the world needed to know that."

Proceeds from the song are going to benefit the Salvation Army's Bethesda Centre, which provides support to young single mothers. MTV notes Bieber's mom Pattie once turned to the organization when she learned she was pregnant with him.

His mother tweeted Thursday, "[Justin] wrote me a song for Mother's day! So excited 4 #TurnToYou out 2morrow, it made me cry.. Proceeds going 2 help single moms!"

But thatâ€™s not all the 18-year-old has done to honor the woman who raised him this year - he also made sure to graduate from high school.

"That was something my mom really wanted me to do, so I had to do it for her," Bieber told People magazine. "I mean, this kind of lifestyle has given me a different perspective on life."

Bieber's new album, "Believe," is due out June 19.
