Justin Bieber, future Virgin Galactic astronaut.
Justin Bieber's reach could soon extend out of this world.

According to a tweet from Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson, the 19-year-old pop star and his manager, Scooter Braun, have joined Ashton Kutcher as the latest celebrities to sign up for a ride on Branson's SpaceShip Two commercial space flight.


"Great to hear @justinbieber & @scooterbraun are latest @virgingalactic future astronauts," Branson tweeted Wednesday. "Congrats, see you up there!"

Branson's passenger spacecraft had its first rocket-powered test flight in April, and plans to continue its test runs with the goal of reaching full space flight by the end of this year.

Biebs and Braun both retweeted Branson's note, with Bieber already thinking ahead to the grander possibilities: "let's shoot a music video in SPACE!! #nextLEVEL."

It's not the first time the singer has shared his dreams of universal stardom, as he tweeted back in February that he wanted to do "a concert in space." NASA was game to assist Bieber at the time, replying, "Maybe we can help with that."

Never say never.
