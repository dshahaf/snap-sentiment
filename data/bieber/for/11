Justin Bieber auctions pet snake for charity
Justin Bieber has attracted a lot of attention with his choice of pet: a baby boa constrictor named Johnson. The pop star and Johnson are set to go their separate ways, however, as the snake's being auctioned off for charity, reports the New York Daily News.

The teen singer is selling his baby boa – who came to our attention at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards – to raise money for Justin’s non-profit of choice, Pencils of Promise.

You’d better have deep pockets if you’re interested in owning Bieber’s snake. According to online auction site Charity Buzz, bidding is already up to $5,750.


The auction site does have a warning on snake ownership for any flaky bidders: “Before making any decision about keeping one please ensure you have the money, space, knowledge, time, resources and enthusiasm required to properly care for the species you intend to keep, for the duration of its life.”

Johnson the snake will head home with the highest bidder – who will be screened for proper pet ownership – after the auction closes November 29.

Seventeen-year-old Bieber is one charitable little dude. Not only is he selling his very own pet snake for a good cause, the singer recently announced the launch of his “Believe” charity drive. Part of the proceeds from the singer's Christmas album, "Under the Mistletoe,” will go to organizations including the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and Johnson’s cause, Pencils of Promise.
