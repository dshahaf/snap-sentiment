Does Erin Andrews have Justin Bieber on the brain?
Is Erin Andrews a Belieber? 

The veteran sports reporter seemed to stumble over her words while interviewing Boston Red Sox player Mike Napoli following a game against the Detroit Tigers. Andrews attempted to ask Napoli about the Tigers’ Justin Verlander but she stumbled over her words and it sounded like she almost said “Justin Bieber” instead. 

She quickly corrected herself but social media took notice of the near mix-up.
My lord..people are unreal RT @NDisch: “@pvdj: @ErinAndrews did you almost say Justin Bieber instead of Verlander in post game interview?”
If u really think I have Bieber on my mind, then u are soooooo right #sarcasm
So did Erin have Bieber on the brain? Take a look at the video and judge for yourself.
