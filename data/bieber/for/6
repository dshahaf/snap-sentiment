Justin Bieber's 'Believe' year's biggest debut.
Justin Bieber has not only notched his fourth No. 1 album with his June release, "Believe," but he's also earned the title of the year's biggest debut, Billboard reports.

Selling 374,000 copies in its first week, Bieber's album surpassed Madonna's first week sales of "MDNA," which tallied 359,000.


(The best sales week overall goes to Adele, who sold 730,000 copies of "21" in the week after her big performance at the Grammys.)

Those who purchased "Believe" will get to hear a song called "Maria," which Bieber's admitted addresses that paternity saga he was embroiled in months ago.

"Maria" takes aim at 20-year-old Mariah Yeater, who brought a paternity case against the singer back in November. The suit has since been dropped.

Bieber explained that he just wanted to do something "a little shcoking" during an appearance on Bethenny Frankel's new talk show, "Bethenny."

“It was something that I’d been feeling and wanted to tell people," the 18-year-old singer said. "Because at the end of the day, you know things happen and I don’t get to really talk about it. People twist my words.”

And his words are quite clear: on "Maria," he sings, “That ain’t my baby, that ain’t my girl,” followed by, “Why are you trying to lie girl when I ain’t never met you at all.”

“I’m really able to explain my side of the story,” he added.
