Justin Bieber gives child battling cancer dream date.
If you still weren't feeling the love on Valentine's Day, this story should help: Six-year-old Avalanna Routh, who is battling cancer, got the chance to meet her dream date, none other than pop star Justin Bieber.

Routh has a rare form of brain cancer called AT/RT, the New York Daily News reports. Last year, the nurses at the 6-year-old's Boston treatment center threw her a pretend wedding in which she "married" a cutout of the 17-year-old pop star.

Thanks to a Facebook page called "Get Avalanna to Meet Justin Bieber," the young singer learned that he had a special super-fan out in Massachusetts.


On Monday, Bieber flew Routh and her family out to New York for a sweet pre-Valentine's Day date filled with board games, cupcakes and candy â€“ as well as a smooch.

Even better, it seems Routh is now for sure Bieber's pretend wife.

"It was great...He wants to be my husband," Routh explained, according to CNN affiliate NECN, and on his Twitter account the singer posted that he was hanging out with "a special little girl #MrsBieber."

"That was one of the best things i have ever done," Bieber tweeted Monday. "She was AWESOME! Feeling really inspired now! #MrsBieber."

According to NECN, Routh's mom is hoping this will raise more awareness about the form of cancer her daughter is fighting.

"This is a beautiful story," she said, "and we need to keep the momentum going and we need to fund finding a cure for AT/RT."
