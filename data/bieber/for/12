Forget Obama, student wants to meet Bieber
Seeing President Obama may have been exciting enough for students at Bluestone High School in Virginia Tuesday, but at least one girl was hoping the commander-in-chief could put her in touch with someone else.

â€œDo you know Justin Bieber?" asked a student during the surprise visit.

"I do," Obama responded. "I do. He's a very nice young man... I think he's got a girlfriend. He's a nice guy."

Obama first met the teen pop star sensation at the White House Easter Egg hunt in 2010 and earlier this year the president arranged for Bieber to meet a fan whose father had died during the 9/11 attacks.
