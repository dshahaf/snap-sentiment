Bieber mania descends on Singapore Grand Prix
Canadian pop idol Justin Bieber could upstage even the likes of Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton at this weekend's Formula One Singapore Grand Prix, organisers said Wednesday.

The 19-year-old, known worldwide for his army of loyal "Beliebers", is set to perform at the street circuit a day after Sunday's night race.

"I think we have had more media mentions and more focus on Justin coming through than Alonso or Lewis Hamilton," said Michael Roche, chief executive of organisers Singapore GP Pte Ltd, half in jest.

Bieber is among a star-studded line-up including Rihanna and American rock band The Killers set to perform at the sidelines of Formula One's only night race.

"I don't think there has been anything we have done that has caused such a stir in five or six years," Roche said.

Singapore, which first held the race in 2008, last year announced a five-year extension to 2017.
