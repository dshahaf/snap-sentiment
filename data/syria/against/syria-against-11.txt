Punishment is not a solution on Syria
President Obama has raised the concept of punishment in defending military intervention in Syria.

There has been much research into the practice of punishment, and we have come a long way in recognizing that punishment is a very ineffective way to change human beings and societies. Yes, it instills fear. And yes, it demonstrates the power of the strong over the weak. But it also creates in the punished a desire for retaliation and a tendency to treat others the way they have been treated.
We may need at times to use force to stop violence, but not for the purpose of punishment.
