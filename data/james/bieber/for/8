Bieber sells out U.S. tour in one hour.
It may have taken more time for you to be seated at brunch this weekend than it did for Justin Bieber to sell out his entire North American tour.

A rep for the pop phenomenon has confirmed that tickets for Bieb’s U.S. Believe tour were gone within 60 minutes when they went on sale Saturday.

His manager Scooter Braun tweeted about the snappy ticket sales over the weekend - particularly ones for New York City's Madison Square Garden.


"What!?! Just found out @justinbieber sold out the entire #BelieveTour North America in 1 Hour and both MSG shows clean in 30 seconds!!!!" Braun wrote. "Blown away ... Now we are gonna make sure the #BelieveTour is as epic as possible ... Thank u for supporting the kid. Amazing."

Bieber’s tour trek will begin on September 29 in Arizona and wrap up January 26, 2013, in Miami.

Last month, Bieber teased anxious concertgoers about what they can expect.

"There's a lot of fun stuff,” the 18-year-old singer told MTV of all the “surprises” he has in store. “I've been really hard at work in the studio, in the dance studio, just kind of figuring out what I want to do as far as choreography and whatnot. I think the tour's going to be really special. We got a lot of surprises."

Hopefully that won't include any surprise glass windows. Bieber, who suffered a concussion after running into a glass wall backstage at a Paris show last week, is currently tackling the overseas market and is apparently headed to Spain next.

His next album, also titled “Believe," will arrive June 19.
