Possible 'Mile-Wide UFO' Spotted by British Airline Pilot.
What's white, glows, is a mile wide and flies?

That's what the pilot and passengers of a British jetliner want to know after they reported seeing an unidentified flying objectfitting that description outside their aircraft windows over the Channel Islands.

The craft is allegedly one of the largest UFOs ever seen, the Evening Standard reported Friday.

Citing an official air-miss report on the incident several weeks ago in Pilot magazine, the newspaper stated that Aurigny Airlines Capt. Ray Bowyer first caught sight of the object while flying close to Alderney , one of several islands in the English Channel located off the Normandy coast.

Bowyer described the object as “a cigar-shaped brilliant white light.”

"It was a very sharp, thin yellow object with a green area," Bowyer, 50, told the Evening Standard, noting that he used a pair of binoculars to view the flying craft more closely. "It was 2,000 feet up and stationary. I thought it was about 10 miles away, although I later realized it was approximately 40 miles from us.

"At first, I thought it was the size of a [Boeing] 737, but it must have been much bigger because of how far away it was. It could have been as much as a mile wide."

Bowyer told the magazine that he then spotted a "second identical object further to the west," stating that it was the same size but appeared smaller because it was farther away from the plane than the first craft was.

Some passengers and an unnamed pilot with the Blue Islands airline later confirmed the sighting, the Evening Standard reported.

The Civil Aviation Authority safety notice stated that another aircraft, a Tri-Lander, flying nearby Alderney also spotted the soaring object.
