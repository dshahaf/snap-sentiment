mississippi man , who shunned spotlight , recalls alleged 1973 incident with ufo . charles hickson never regretted the notoriety that came his way after he told authorities he encountered an unidentified flying object and its occupants 40 years ago on the banks of the pascagoula river . until his death in 2011 , hickson told his story to anyone who would listen . but calvin parker jr. , the other man present for one of the most high-profile ufo cases in american history , has never come to terms with what he still says was a visit with gray , crab-clawed creatures from somewhere else . he says the encounter on oct. 11 , 1973 , turned his life upside down . `` this is something i really did n't want to happen , '' parker told the associated press as the 40th anniversary of the encounter approached . parker was unnerved by initial crush of unwelcome attention , with newsmen and ufo enthusiasts overrunning walker shipyard , where he and hickson worked . he tried to dodge the spotlight for decades , moving frequently before returning to mississippi 's gulf coast in recent years . `` they gave a thorough , i mean a thorough , examination to me just like any doctor would '' - calvin parker jr the incident made headlines , sparked a wave of ufo sightings nationwide and became one of the most widely examined cases on record . skeptics ranged from the deputies who first interviewed the men to an author who sought to poke holes in the story , and parker himself has had conflicting thoughts about whether he was visited by aliens or demons . parker , now 58 , was 18 when he went fishing with hickson on a tranquil thursday night after work . as they dangled their lines without much luck , the two said a ufo with blue lights swooped down . they told of a zipping noise made by the object . hickson , then 42 , said three creatures with leathery gray skin and crab-like claws - he thought they were robots - took them by the forearms and levitated them aboard the craft . he said something that looked like a large floating eye appeared to examine him . parker says he was conscious but paralyzed . `` they gave a thorough , i mean a thorough , examination to me just like any doctor would , '' he said . and then they were back on the shore , where it all began . the ufo was gone and parker said they tried to collect themselves . hickson needed three shots of liquor from a bottle in his car to calm his nerves before deciding to report what happened . at the jackson county sheriff 's department , deputies initially suspected both men were drunk . then-capt . glenn ryder , who still works for the sheriff 's office , said he laughed at the report , but met with the men . parker and hickson stuck to their story . after the formal interview , deputies left hickson and parker together in a room with a hidden tape recorder , hoping to catch them in a lie . `` me and the other investigator got up and left to let them talk , to see if they were going to say , `well , we got them fooled , ' but they did n't , '' ryder said . `` they were really concerned . `` on the tape , hickson tells parker , `` it scared me to death too , son . you ca n't get over it in a lifetime . jesus christ have mercy . `` `` i do n't know what happened to them , '' ryder said . `` i was n't there with them , but i know you do n't fake fear , and they were fearful . they were fearful . `` the next afternoon , the story was splashed across the front pages of newspapers in pascagoula and gulfport . overnight , pascagoula became a magnet for news reporters and ufo investigators . widespread interest in ufos began in the 1940s with an incident at roswell n.m. , in which ufo enthusiasts believe the government got its hands on a crashed ufo and alien bodies . the government spent decades denying it . in the 1960s , interest flared anew with a series of reports , including the purported alien abduction of new hampshire couple betty and barney hill in 1961. the widespread attention to the pascagoula encounter set off a new round of reports . in south mississippi , hundreds of reports overwhelmed authorities in the two weeks after the hickson-parker encounter . there were hoaxes and humor too . a long beach , miss. , taxi driver told police a being with pincers tapped on his window , a story he admitted days later was fake . a mobile , ala. , television station said it would record a ufo appearance predicted by a psychic between mobile and nearby pascagoula . roughly 1,000 cars converged on the spot , where nothing happened . an ocean springs alderman proposed an ordinance making it illegal to operate a ufo at more than twice the speed of light on u.s. 90 , the coast 's main drag . mayor tom stennis voted against the ordinance , joking he did n't want to discourage tourism . ufo skeptic philip klass believed hickson and parker 's report was a hoax . in his book `` ufos explained , '' he noted hickson changed some details of his story and claimed a polygraph operator whose test hickson passed was n't up to the task . parker later passed a lie detector test himself . hickson would go on to appear on talk shows , give lectures and interviews , and self-publish a book in 1983 titled `` ufo contact at pascagoula . `` he reported three more encounters in 1974 , and said the aliens communicated to him that they were peaceful . `` the only thing he wanted to do was let everybody know we were not alone , '' said eddie hickson , his son . `` he did n't care if you believed him or not . if you wanted to listen , by gum , he 'd tell you . `` `` he could never understand why he was chosen , '' the younger hickson added . `` but he never once told me that he wished it had never happened . never . `` parker said the intrusions by curiosity seekers have become less frequent over the years , but have never really let up . `` you do n't never have no privacy , '' he said . parker married later in 1973 and eventually took oil industry and out-of-state construction jobs to escape the attention . `` by the time you get somewhere and they figure out who you were , i 'd just go , '' he said . `` i 'd just go find another job somewhere . `` parker attended some ufo conventions , and was once hypnotized by budd hopkins , a noted ufo investigator . he briefly tried to capitalize on his story in 1993 by starting a louisiana company called ufo investigations where he and partners would produce television segments on the subject . parker moved to moss point in 2006 and in 2010 suffered a stroke that limited him physically . he 's on disability aid now , but sometimes boats by the site of the encounter when he goes fishing . he said that just recently he met a woman at a gas station who already knew who he was . `` i 'm always recognized , '' he said . there 's no historical marker on the river bank noting the encounter , and stores do n't sell ufo souvenirs . but local people remember - though often with skepticism and jokes . for his part , parker said he 's had conflicting thoughts over the years about that night in 1973. at one point , he was n't even sure the creatures were aliens . they might have been demons , he said . `` i 'm a firm believer in god and where there 's good , there 's bad , '' parker said .
passenger jet almost collided with ufo over england . a passenger jet coming in to land at heathrow airport had a near miss with a ufo , according to newly-released british ministry of defense files . the captain of the alitalia airliner was so concerned he shouted `` look out '' to his co-pilot after seeing the brown missile-shaped object shoot past them overhead . the mysterious incident near lydd in kent in 1991 was thoroughly investigated by britain 's civil aviation authority ( caa ) and the british military . but having ruled out the object being a missile , weather balloon or space rocket , the mod closed the inquiry and left the matter unsolved . the unexplained close encounter is one of many recounted in military ufo documents now made available online by the national archives . documents show the mcdonnell douglas md80 aircraft was en route from milan to heathrow at 22,000 feet with 57 people on board when pilot achille zaghetti saw the strange object 1,000 feet above him . he recounted : `` at once i said , 'look out , look out , ' to my co-pilot , who looked out and saw what i had seen . `` as soon as the object crossed us i asked to the acc ( area control center ) operator if he saw something on his screen and he answered 'i see an unknown target 10 nm ( nautical miles ) behind you ' . ``
russian navy reveals its secret ufo encounters . it sounds like the classic science movie `` the abyss '' only in russian . the russian navy has declassified its records of ufo encounters , many of which take place in or around water , reports the web site of the english-language russian news channel russia today . `` they are most often seen in the deepest part of the atlantic ocean , in the southern part of the bermuda triangle , and also in the caribbean sea , '' said one naval intelligence officer quoted by the web site . another incident cited involved six unknown objects that followed a nuclear submarine in the pacific . when the sub surfaced , so did the objects which then lifted themselves out of the water and flew away . in perhaps the most compelling account , military divers in siberia 's lake baikal , the world 's deepest lake , encountered `` a group of humanoid creatures dressed in silvery suits '' at a depth of 160 feet . three humans died during the ensuing chase .
russian scientist : ufo crashed into meteorite to save earth . did a ufo deliberately crash into a meteor to save earth 100 years ago ? that 's what one russian scientist is claiming . dr. yuri labvin , president of the tunguska spatial phenomenon foundation , insists that an alien spacecraft sacrificed itself to prevent a gigantic meteor from slamming into the planet above siberia on june 30 , 1908. the result was was the tunguska event , a massive blast estimated at 15 megatons that downed 80 million trees over nearly 100 square miles . eyewitnesses reported a bright light and a huge shock wave , but the area was so sparsely populated no one was killed . most scientists think the blast was caused by a meteorite exploding several miles above the surface . but labvin thinks quartz slabs with strange markings found at the site are remnants of an alien control panel , which fell to the ground after the ufo slammed into the giant rock . `` we do n't have any technologies that can print such kind of drawings on crystals , '' labvin told the macedonian international news agency . `` we also found ferrum silicate that can not be produced anywhere , except in space . ``
possible 'mile-wide ufo ' spotted by british airline pilot . what 's white , glows , is a mile wide and flies ? that 's what the pilot and passengers of a british jetliner want to know after they reported seeing an unidentified flying objectfitting that description outside their aircraft windows over the channel islands . the craft is allegedly one of the largest ufos ever seen , the evening standard reported friday . click here to read the evening standard story , citing an official air-miss report on the incident several weeks ago in pilot magazine , the newspaper stated that aurigny airlines capt . ray bowyer first caught sight of the object while flying close to alderney , one of several islands in the english channel located off the normandy coast . bowyer described the object as a cigar-shaped brilliant white light . `` it was a very sharp , thin yellow object with a green area , '' bowyer , 50 , told the evening standard , noting that he used a pair of binoculars to view the flying craft more closely . `` it was 2,000 feet up and stationary . i thought it was about 10 miles away , although i later realized it was approximately 40 miles from us . `` at first , i thought it was the size of a [ boeing ] 737 , but it must have been much bigger because of how far away it was . it could have been as much as a mile wide . `` click here to visit foxnews.com 's space center . bowyer told the magazine that he then spotted a `` second identical object further to the west , '' stating that it was the same size but appeared smaller because it was farther away from the plane than the first craft was . some passengers and an unnamed pilot with the blue islands airline later confirmed the sighting , the evening standard reported . the civil aviation authority safety notice stated that another aircraft , a tri-lander , flying nearby alderney also spotted the soaring object .
2 ufo sightings have china , blogs abuzz . ( cnn ) -- talk about eerie . one of two recent ufo sightings in china occurred almost on the 63rd anniversary of news that a `` flying disc '' had been found in roswell , new mexico . and like in 1947 , people either choose to believe or be skeptical that visitors have stopped by from outer space . nothing has officially been ruled in or out by chinese officials , who are looking into whether the objects were private or military aircraft , rocket flares , reflection in the sky or something else . the first sighting occurred at hangzhou 's xiaoshan airport , in the eastern part of the country , according to the state-controlled xinhua news agency . eighteen flights were delayed or rerouted and operations shut down after twinkling lights were spotted above the terminal around 9 p.m. july 7 , the agency said . according to xinhua , speculation has centered on a private aircraft . the state-run china daily quoted a source saying the object had a military connection . `` no conclusion has yet been drawn , '' said wang jian , head of air traffic control with zhejiang branch of the civil aviation administration of china , and the investigation continues . purported photos of the unworldly object have appeared online and on youtube . meanwhile , the shanghai daily reported a ufo appeared above the city of chongqing on thursday . witnesses said four `` lantern-like objects forming a diamond shape '' hovered for an hour above a park . `` i stared at it and it did not move , '' one resident told the newspaper . `` after hovering for an hour , the thing started to fly higher and finally out of people 's sight . `` ufo sightings around the world are common , but a little rarer in china . the international ufo museum and research center in roswell , new mexico , educates visitors , conducts research and receives sighting reports . its website summarizes the roswell incident , which came to light july 8 , 1947 . `` once it became public , the event known as the roswell incident , the crash of an alleged flying saucer , the recovery of debris and bodies and the ensuing cover up by the military was of such magnitude and so shrouded in mystery , that 60 years later there are still more questions than answers . `` the u.s. government has long contended that no aliens or spaceships were found . mark briscoe , library director for the museum , said the center looks for credibility whenever it records ufo reports , including a documented date , time and location . he sees many photos , and an outside researcher provides information . `` you can tell some of them are a little different . a little off , '' briscoe said of some ufo submissions . but he recently recorded 300 he found to be credible . he said one of the photos circulating about the chinese airport could be legitimate , but he had not seen the others . the blog forgetomori weighed in on internet and news media images purporting to be from xiaoshan airport . `` all of these other photos , with the exception of a single one , are also simply long-exposure photos of aircrafts , but in this case , helicopters , '' the blog says . `` not only that , they have nothing to do with china and were published on the web long ago . ``
former astronaut : man not alone in universe . ( cnn ) -- earth day may fall later this week , but as far as former nasa astronaut edgar mitchell and other ufo enthusiasts are concerned , the real story is happening elsewhere . mitchell , who was part of the 1971 apollo 14 moon mission , asserted monday that extraterrestrial life exists , and that the truth is being concealed by the u.s. and other governments . he delivered his remarks during an appearance at the national press club following the conclusion of the fifth annual x-conference , a meeting of ufo activists and researchers studying the possibility of alien life forms . mankind has long wondered if we 're `` alone in the universe . [ but ] only in our period do we really have evidence . no , we 're not alone , '' mitchell said . `` our destiny , in my opinion , and we might as well get started with it , is [ to ] become a part of the planetary community . ... we should be ready to reach out beyond our planet and beyond our solar system to find out what is really going on out there . `` mitchell grew up in roswell , new mexico , which some ufo believers maintain was the site of a ufo crash in 1947. he said residents of his hometown `` had been hushed and told not to talk about their experience by military authorities . `` they had been warned of `` dire consequences '' if they did so . but , he claimed , they `` did n't want to go to the grave with their story . they wanted to tell somebody reliable . and being a local boy and having been to the moon , they considered me reliable enough to whisper in my ear their particular story . `` roughly 10 years ago , mitchell claimed , he was finally given an appointment at pentagon to discuss what he had been told . an unnamed admiral working for the joint chiefs of staff promised to uncover the truth behind the roswell story , mitchell said . the stories of a ufo crash `` were confirmed , '' but the admiral was then denied access when he `` tried to get into the inner workings of that process . `` the same admiral , mitchell claimed , now denies the story . `` i urge those who are doubtful : read the books , read the lore , start to understand what has really been going on . because there really is no doubt we are being visited , '' he said . `` the universe that we live in is much more wondrous , exciting , complex and far-reaching than we were ever able to know up to this point in time . `` a nasa spokesman denied any cover-up . `` nasa does not track ufos . nasa is not involved in any sort of cover-up about alien life on this planet or anywhere else -- period , '' michael cabbage said monday . debates have continued about what happened at roswell . the u.s. air force said in 1994 that wreckage recovered there in 1947 was most likely from a balloon-launched classified government project . stephen bassett , head of the paradigm research group ( prg ) , which hosted the x-conference , said that the truth about extraterrestrial life is being suppressed because it is politically explosive . `` there is a third rail [ in american politics ] , and that is the ufo question . it is many magnitudes more radioactive than social security ever dreamed to be , '' bassett said .
ufos eyed nukes , ex-air force personnel say . seven former u.s. air force personnel gathered in washington monday to recount ufo sightings over nuclear weapons facilities in decades past accounts that a ufo researcher says show extraterrestrial beings are interested in the world s nuclear arms race and may be sending humans a message . at a news conference at the national press club , the six former officers and one ex-enlisted man recalled either personal sightings or reports from subordinates and others of ufos hovering over nuclear missile silos or nuclear weapons storage areas in the 1960s , '70s and '80s . three of the former air force officers though they hadn t seen the ufos themselves - told reporters that ufos hovering over silos around montana s malmstrom air force base in 1967 appeared to have temporarily deactivated some of the nuclear missiles . much of the testimony already has appeared in books , websites and elsewhere . but ufo researcher and author robert hastings , who organized the news conference , said the time has come for the u.s. government to acknowledge the ufo visits . i believe - these gentlemen believe - that this planet is being visited by beings from another world , who for whatever reason have taken an interest in the nuclear arms race which began at the end of world war ii , said hastings , who added that more than 120 former military personnel have told him about ufos visiting nuclear sites . regarding the missile shutdown incidents , my opinion is that whoever are aboard these craft are sending a signal to both washington and moscow , among others , that we are playing with fire that the possession and threatened use of nuclear weapons potentially threatens the human race and the integrity of the planetary environment , he said . former air force capt . robert salas who has written a book about the montana incidents said he was underground when a ufo hovered over his missile silo in march 1967 , and therefore couldn t see it . he said one of his guards above ground told him a red , glowing object about 30 feet in diameter was hovering just above the front gate of the facility , in an isolated area far from malmstrom . and just as i [ called my commander ] , our missiles began going into what s called a no-go condition , or unlaunchable . essentially , they were disabled while this object was still hovering over out site , salas said . salas and others said the military urged them at the time not to talk about the incidents . retired col. charles halt recalled seeing ufos over the woods near royal air force stations bentwaters and woodbridge in eastern england in december 1980. he and security personnel were investigating reports of strange lights just outside one of the bases . all through the forest was a bright glowing object , he said monday . the best way i can describe it , it looked like an eye with bright red , with a dark center . it appeared to be winking . it was shedding something like molten metal , was dripping off it . it silently moved through the trees , avoiding any contact , it bobbed up and down , and at one point it actually approached us . we tried to get closer . it receded out into the field , beyond the forest , and silently exploded into five white objects gone . so we went out into the field looking for any evidence , because something had been apparently falling off it and we find nothing , he said . he recalled subsequently seeing other objects in the sky , including one that stopped about 3,000 feet overhead and sent down a concentrated beam at our feet . no one was harmed . the best way i can equate it is sort of a laser beam . we stood there in awe . was this a warning ? was this an attempt to communicate ? was this a weapon ? or just a probe ? he said . at about the same time , he was hearing radio reports from base personnel that beams from some of the objects were falling into or near the weapons storage area . in a staff meeting later , a general decided it happened off base , so it s a british affair , halt recalled . in other words , they were loathe to get involved . the air force investigated ufos from 1948 to 1969 under a program eventually called project blue book . the service , on its website , says the project concluded that no ufo reported , investigated , and evaluated by the air force has ever given any indication of threat to our national security . it also says there has been `` no evidence that sightings categorized as 'unidentified ' are extraterrestrial vehicles . `` salas said the ufo phenomenon is real , not imaginary . there is current excessive secrecy in our government surrounding this phenomenon , he said . a reporter asked how many of the former military personnel subscribed to hastings theory that the message of extraterrestrials is that humans should get rid of nuclear weapons , and how many of them believed that we should get rid of nukes . of the seven , it appeared that only salas raised his hand .
uk : jet captain reported ufo sighting . london , england ( cnn ) -- thousands of documents about reported ufo sightings -- ranging from calm accounts by professional pilots to unhinged rants about the extraterrestrial menace -- have been released by the british ministry of defence . the 4,500 pages cover sightings that were reported from 1986 through 1992. the british military released them to a curious public as part of a four-year project to transfer all such documents to the national archives . one highlight from the batch released monday involves the captain of an italian airliner . he shouted `` look out ! `` to his co-pilot in april 1991 after claiming to see a beige `` missile-shaped object '' shoot past the cockpit . in that instance , the defence ministry ruled out a missile and `` all the usual explanations , '' wrote david clarke , a ufo expert and journalism instructor at sheffield hallam university , who worked with the national archives to prepare the new materials for release . `` the end result was this was a genuine ufo and the file was simply closed , '' he wrote . `` there was nothing more they could do . `` the newly released documents also carry an account by a u.s. air force pilot who says he was told to shoot down an unidentified flying craft over eastern england . but before he could fire , the object disappeared . the next day , a man arrived to debrief the pilot and `` he was told in no uncertain terms that what he had seen on his radar was top secret and he was n't to speak about it to anyone , '' clarke wrote . the first set of files was made available to members of the public in may . it covered reported ufo sightings from 1978 to 1987 , and included hundreds of police reports taken from witnesses who described seeing lights or strange objects in the sky . people who reported having seen ufos typically describe various shapes and colors of lights , moving in formation or hovering in the sky . witnesses reported orange , red , white and green lights that were diamond-shaped , square , or cigar-shaped . they reported them to police , who have a standard 16-question form specifically for ufo sightings . `` the vast majority of them are just ordinary people who 've seen something unusual and thought that they ought to tell someone about it , '' clarke has said . the ministry of defence said it examined the reports solely to determine whether enemy aircraft had infiltrated british airspace . once it was determined that no enemy aircraft were in the sky , it did not investigate further . `` the ministry of defence has no other interest or role regarding ufo matters and does not consider questions regarding the existence or otherwise of extraterrestrial life-forms , '' it said in may . that left many incidents unexplained .
symington : i saw a ufo in the arizona sky . former arizona governor fife symington will be moderating a november 12 event at the national press club where he will discuss the phoenix lights incident . he says he will be joined by 14 former high-ranking military and government officials from seven countries who will share evidence from what they call their own ufo experiences and investigations . ( cnn ) -- in 1997 , during my second term as governor of arizona , i saw something that defied logic and challenged my reality . i witnessed a massive delta-shaped , craft silently navigate over squaw peak , a mountain range in phoenix , arizona . it was truly breathtaking . i was absolutely stunned because i was turning to the west looking for the distant phoenix lights . to my astonishment this apparition appeared ; this dramatically large , very distinctive leading edge with some enormous lights was traveling through the arizona sky . as a pilot and a former air force officer , i can definitively say that this craft did not resemble any man-made object i 'd ever seen . and it was certainly not high-altitude flares because flares do n't fly in formation . the incident was witnessed by hundreds -- if not thousands -- of people in arizona , and my office was besieged with phone calls from very concerned arizonians . the growing hysteria intensified when the story broke nationally . i decided to lighten the mood of the state by calling a press conference where my chief of staff arrived in an alien costume . we managed to lessen the sense of panic but , at the same time , upset many of my constituents . i would now like to set the record straight . i never meant to ridicule anyone . my office did make inquiries as to the origin of the craft , but to this day they remain unanswered . eventually the air force claimed responsibility stating that they dropped flares . this is indicative of the attitude from official channels . we get explanations that fly in the face of the facts . explanations like weather balloons , swamp gas and military flares . i was never happy with the air force 's silly explanation . there might very well have been military flares in the sky that evening , but what i and hundreds of others saw had nothing to do with that . i now know that i am not alone . there are many high-ranking military , aviation and government officials who share my concerns . while on active duty , they have either witnessed a ufo incident or have conducted an official investigation into ufo cases relevant to aviation safety and national security . by speaking out with me , these people are putting their reputations on the line . they have fought in wars , guarded top secret weapons arsenals and protected our nation 's skies . we want the government to stop putting out stories that perpetuate the myth that all ufos can be explained away in down-to-earth conventional terms . investigations need to be re-opened , documents need to be unsealed and the idea of an open dialogue can no longer be shunned . incidents like these are not going away . about a year ago , chicago 's o'hare international airport experienced a ufo event that made national and international headlines . what i saw in the arizona sky goes beyond conventional explanations . when it comes to events of this nature that are still completely unsolved , we deserve more openness in government , especially our own .
silicon valley ceo turns ufo evangelist . ( idg ) -- joe firmage does not seem crazy . his words do not echo like the proclamations of a zealot but rather are delivered in a controlled , deliberate , boardroom fashion . they sound like the words of a man who was forming a strategy for building web sites one day - and forming a strategy for a techno-spiritual evolution the next . somehow , firmage 's manner makes the progression seem natural . joe firmage wants you to believe what he believes . to wit : `` you are a homo sapien animal , sitting at the top of an 8,000-mile-wide clump of geology , staring into an electronic communications system called 'the internet ' ... 2,000 revolutions around this globe since the birth of a man named jesus . that 's a more accurate picture of you in the eyes of the cosmos right now . `` joe firmage says that without blinking . joseph p. firmage , 28 , founded usweb , a leading internet consulting firm , in 1995. like his previous ventures , the company prospered wildly . for fiscal 1998 , usweb posted revenue of $ 228 million - a 100 % increase over the previous year . during that year of intense growth , joe firmage was moonlighting - working on the kairos project , a web site and book ( due this summer ) about human evolution and extraterrestrials . word got out . in january , firmage posted his 700-page manifesto , called `` the truth '' ( www.thewordistruth.org ) , which evokes both star trek and the new testament . in the manifesto , firmage asserts that extraterrestrials not only have visited us , but also have influenced our technological development . a few days later , he resigned . so is he a `` crackpot , '' as usweb/cks ( the companies merged shortly before firmage left ) board member gary reischel recently pronounced him , summing up what he 'd heard from colleagues and investors ? or is he a maverick entrepreneur with disturbing ideas who is paying with his credibility for the strength of his convictions ? quiet certainty joe firmage does not look like a man who 's spent 3 million of his own dollars researching extraterrestrials . in tony los gatos , calif. , in a living room almost too small for its opulent furniture , he speaks without flourish , with pregnant pauses and sustained eye-blinks as much as with bold words . he wears a discreetly trimmed beard and is dressed casually , as per the uniform of silicon valley executives ( including mandatory cell phone , which periodically interrupts an interview ) . out front in the driveway , a cardboard jesus hangs from the rearview mirror of his red corvette . firmage is both savvy and candid about all the attention the world is paying him . `` i 've been very open to the media for 10 years now in a business context , '' he says , but `` i 've given nobody reason to question my sanity until six months ago . i 'm just starting to get the pr structure to deal with the media . `` when he first published his manifesto , the news stories tended toward predictable snickering , but firmage says he believes `` it 's beginning to shift in the right direction . rolling stone is doing a good piece on us . time 's already done something . i 'll be on dateline [ nbc ] . i just spent the whole day with abc news . `` how does he expect those tv interviews to go ? `` everything can and will be used against me , '' he laughs . early achiever firmage was born and raised in salt lake city , where his family belonged to the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints ( `` it 's a very cosmic thing , '' he says of the mormon church ) . after finishing high school in a mere two years , a scholarship in physics led him to the university of utah . firmage left college in 1989 after his sophomore year to form his first venture : serius , which began as a macintosh program for his mother 's greeting card business and quickly grew into a database software company . result ? `` within six months , '' firmage says , serius `` closed $ 7 million '' in revenue . in 1993 , firmage sold the company to novell inc. for $ 24 million and a vice presidency . in 1995 , he left to found usweb . according to novell public relations manager jonathan cohen , the company considered firmage a `` valued contributor ... . we would n't comment on his beliefs or cultural activities . `` the real deal `` i am convinced that the ufo phenomenon is absolutely legitimate , '' firmage says . `` i have sat across the table from people whose credibility is unimpeachable . `` people who have described to him in great detail their experiences as alien abductees , he says . asked to mention names , he replies , `` i ca n't . `` the cultural activities cohen mentions can be traced , firmage says , to a vision he had early one morning in 1997 , shortly before usweb 's initial public offering . a mysterious figure clad in white hovered over his bed , he recalls . the two shared a brief conversation about space-time travel . when asked by the visitor why he should be given the chance to travel in space , firmage said , `` because i 'm willing to die for it . `` the following year was `` the busiest time of my professional life , '' he says . `` i held a 12-hour-per-day job at usweb , with kairos [ the ufo project ] growing to four to six hours per day . i had a simple system : daytime : usweb ; evening : kairos . `` a year after the visit , firmage posted his manuscript online . a media flood followed . then came investor jitters . `` for the record , i chose to step down , '' firmage says . `` and off the record , i chose to step down . that 's the truth . i was not forced out . now , had i not chosen to step down , i could well have been forced out . i 've been 10 years in this valley . i know how the game is played . `` is there no room for visions like his in silicon valley ? `` i would like the answer to be yes . but right now ... no . `` maybe that 's why , firmage claims , there are several silicon valley leaders hiding their own belief in extraterrestrials ( he declines several times to mention names ) . why the need to remain quiet ? `` well , look what happened to me . `` man of principle ? `` frankly , i admire the guy , '' says author and columnist robert cringely . `` in a world filled with weasels who call themselves entrepreneurs and who will corrupt their business plan to fit whatever is this week 's hot technology , firmage stands out as a man of principle . `` and now out of the boardroom , firmage is free to discuss those principles . `` i can say things i could never say '' when at the helm of usweb , he says . `` every single executive of a public company has to live that way . `` he says steve jobs and bill gates are exceptions who `` have a measure of freedom that anybody just one notch down on that ladder does not have . `` one of firmage 's goals , he says , `` is to make things that have not been permitted to be spoken in open company , speakable . things that deal with anomalies . things that deal with spirituality . `` things like zero-point energy and gravitational propulsion . those controversial theories of physics underpin firmage 's belief in space-time travel . zero-point energy refers to a theory that energy can be created from nothing , rather than matter . gravitational propulsion is based on the concept that the force of gravity can not only be harnessed , but also engineered . combined , the two provide the foundation for spacecraft capable of warp speeds . firmage 's beliefs have backers . john peterson , a futurist and head of the arlington institute , a nonprofit research group in arlington , va. , is adamant about zero-point energy . `` there 's no question but that it 's real . `` and charles ostman , senior fellow at the san francisco-based institute for global futures , says that , in 25 to 50 years , `` we probably will have things like antigravity travel , time-space continuum manipulation - all the usual precursors [ to ] getting around the universe . `` not all scientists agree . in fact , not all seekers of extraterrestrials agree . dan wertheimer , director of the university of california at berkeley 's search for extra-terrestrial intelligence program , calls firmage 's ideas `` pretty wacko ... you 'd be hard-pressed to find any scientist that thought there was an ounce of credibility in his ideas . `` visionary or crackpot ? you 'd also be hard-pressed to find a silicon valley ceo who does n't drone on about vision and evolution and progress . if nothing else , joe firmage 's story is the story of what happens when the vision becomes intensely personal , when public relations buffers melt away and the board runs for cover . it 's impossible not to wonder at firmage 's motivations . is this story about a yearning for liberation from the corporate structure ? ( when usweb and cks merged , firmage was not named ceo of the combined company . ) is firmage after a piece of history ? is this a publicity trick , a plan to get richer ? ( after all , that cell phone keeps ringing . ) or is this as simple as one man telling his version of the truth - and paying for it dearly : `` what happens in the history of a world when its most advanced beings for the first time gain the power to break through its own gravity well ? `` joe firmage asks . `` i 'll tell you what it 's called ; it 's called birth . if earth is a living being , and we are created by the earth , and we one day gain that power , the power to touch the fabric of space-time itself , and use it , tap it , to voyage - is that not literally a birth ? and is not the history of humanity an incredible drum roll to the opening of the first real frontier ? that 's the vision that i see . ``
rep. dennis kucinich acknowledges ufo sighting . the truth is out there , and ohio rep. dennis kucinich had no trouble offering his version of it when asked tuesday night about his ufo sighting . `` it was an unidentified flying object , ok ? it 's , like , it 's unidentified , '' kucinich said during one of the few highlights at the democratic presidential debate in philadelphia . `` i saw something . `` kucinich , whose ufo run-in came to light last week in a passage from shirley maclaine 's new book , went on to joke that he planned to move his campaign office to roswell , n.m. roswell is the place where legend holds a spacecraft crash-landed in 1947 and was recovered and moved for investigation to nearby area 51 , a secretive u.s. government airbase in nevada . kucinich went on to defend himself , saying many americans have shared his experience . `` you have to keep in mind that more that jimmy carter saw a ufo and also that more people in this country have seen ufos than i think approve of george bush 's presidency , '' kucinich said . debate moderator tim russert then cited a poll saying that 14 percent of americans claim to have seen a ufo , to which kucinich asked : `` what as that percentage ? `` `` fourteen , '' russert answered . `` thank you , '' kucinich responded with satisfaction . president bush 's approval rating stood at 35 percent in the most recent fox news-opinion dynamics poll , but only 12 percent of democrats gave him a thumbs up . earlier tuesday , kucinich questioned the president 's mental state in lieu of comments made about a nuclear iran sparking world war iii . `` i seriously believe we have to start asking questions about his mental health , '' kucinich said in an interview with the philadelphia inquirer . `` there 's something wrong . he does not seem to understand his words have real impact . `` according to maclaine , kucinich saw the ufo in the 1980s while visiting the actress at her home in washington state . `` he saw a gigantic triangular craft , silent and observing him , '' maclaine wrote . `` it hovered for about 10 minutes or so and sped away with a speed he could n't comprehend . he felt a connection in his heart and heard directions in his mind . `` moving on in the debate questioning , russert asked sen. barack obama about his belief in the existence of life beyond earth . `` i do n't presume to know . what i know is there is life here on earth , and and that we 're not attending to life here on earth , '' obama said .
u.s. pilot ordered to shoot down ufo over england . a former top gun said sunday he was ordered to shoot down a massive ufo over norwich , england , 50 years ago . raf controllers told u.s. pilot milton torres to lock on and launch all 24 of his rockets over the city . but as he came within seconds of firing at the alien intruder the size of an aircraft carrier on his radar it vanished at 10,000 mph . the amazing close encounter is revealed in secret ministry of defense x-files which are being declassified monday . milton said , it was some kind of alien snooping over england . i guess we ll never know what it was . the incident happened in 1957 when milton was a 26-year-old u.s. air force lieutenant based at raf manston in kent , england . at 11 p.m. one night he was ordered to scramble in his f-86d sabre fighter to attack a bogey hovering above norfolk . speaking about it publicly for the first time , he said : i was told i would be firing a complete salvo , all 24 rockets . i was pumped up this was the sort of thing that happened before a war . he got the ufo on his radar and closed for the attack at the sabre s top speed of almost 700 mph then it disappeared off his screen in a flash . milton , now 77 , said : i was smoking , as fast as i could go . this thing had a different propulsion system . it was not an airplane . the flyer said he was visited afterwards by a sinister security official and warned not to tell anyone so he kept silent until now . the close encounter is in 19 files made available online yesterday by the national archives .
mysterious 'ufo ' over kentucky explained . google , it is cheekily said , knows everything even , apparently , the origin of an unidentified flying object . on oct. 16 , 2012 , residents of pike county , ky. , looked high in the sky to find a strange sight . amateur astronomer allen epling described it to a local reporter as looking `` like two fluorescent bulbs , side by side , parallel , shining very brightly . `` `` it would get so bright they would seem to merge , and you could see it very clearly with the naked eye , '' epling said . `` then , it would dim down almost invisible ... it was n't anything i recognized . definitely not an airplane , and i 've never seen a helicopter that looked like that . `` epling was n't the only one who noticed ; police in kentucky , virginia and tennessee got phone calls from concerned citizens . calls were made to nearby airports , but government officials could shed no light on it . the unidentified flying object , estimated to have reached an altitude of 60,000 feet , remained more or less stationary for hours , suggesting that it was tethered to the ground somehow , or hovering under its own power . [ 7 things most often mistaken for ufos ] and now , the origin of the bright bulbs has been found . explanations and speculations alien spacecraft were , of course , suspected . the most likely explanation a balloon of some sort was floated , but led to further mystery and shadowy speculation . what entity placed it there , and what was its purpose ? was it spying on unwitting americans ? or was it sampling or even creating so-called `` chemtrails , '' those lines in the sky that resemble normal airplane contrails but are suspected of being anything from extraterrestrial signals to mind-control experiments to weather-controlling machinery ? many thought top-secret chemical agents were involved , which raises the question of what possible purpose the chemtrails would serve . as bob carroll notes in his book `` the skeptic 's dictionary '' ( wiley , 2003 ) , `` any biological or chemical agents released at 25,000 feet or above would be absolutely impossible to control , making any measurement of effects on the ground nearly impossible ... such an exercise would be pointless , unless you just wanted to pollute the atmosphere . `` besides that , the fact that the u.s. government did n't know or , depending on your point of view , claimed not to know what the object was simply fueled the speculation . obviously , whatever was that big and high up in the sky was not put there by a hobbyist , and if no one at the air force or pentagon truly knew what it was , perhaps a private company , or maybe even a foreign power , was behind it . the reports and news faded away , but the mysterious object hung like a question mark in the sky . secret revealed now , an article in wired magazine has revealed the secret behind the mysterious craft : a google-financed tech endeavor code-named project loon . `` the people in pike county were witnessing a test of project loon , a breathtakingly ambitious plan to bring the internet to a huge swath of as-yet-unconnected humanity via thousands of solar-powered , high-pressure balloons floating some 60,000 feet above earth , '' wrote wired 's steven levy . the balloon stayed aloft for 11 days before reaching canada , levy reports . the project loon balloons , while providing fodder for ufo websites and conspiracy theorists , travel `` on the edge of space , designed to connect people in rural and remote areas , help fill coverage gaps and bring people back online after disasters , '' according to the project 's website . the solar-powered balloons would circle the planet , floating in rings about 12 miles ( 19 kilometers ) above earth in the stratosphere ( about twice the altitude at which commercial airplanes fly ) . `` people connect to the balloon network using a special internet antenna attached to their building . the signal bounces from balloon to balloon , then to the global internet back on earth , '' the website reads . the result ? low-cost internet access . so the mysterious ufo was , indeed , the result of a technologically advanced civilization , but it seems that civilization comes in peace and is here to help us or at least provide affordable wi-fi to rural populations .
dennis kucinich 's ufo comments prove he 's nuts . now i know he 's not going to be president , so there is an argument for not giving dennis kucinich a kick in the pants . but , with apologies to the congressman in advance , i 'm afraid i must . about 24 hours after democratic presidential candidate dennis kucinich pronounced president bush crazy for even thinking there might have to be war with iran , the ohio congressman was asked if , in fact , while visiting with shirley maclaine he had actually seen a ufo . remember : this is a guy who feels free to say bush is crazy one day and admit something the next day that many , if not most , people think proves a person is crazy . if you 've seen ufos you probably should n't go around calling other people nuts . if you admit to seeing a ufo , martians , space creatures , big foot and all the rest , you are by definition on the defensive against a charge of craziness . the congressman does n't eat meat . perhaps that is an explanation . and the rest of you who have seen ufos , please do n't send angry e-mails . it 's not going to make any difference -- i 'll still think y'all are crazy . oh , and by the way , it is n't just bush who thinks we might be forced into conflict with iran . the french president said so publicly at his u.n. speech a couple months ago . and even muslim states are recognizing this might be reality . it 's bad , but it 's not crazy . however , now we know who actually is crazy . that 's my word .
denver 'ufo ' likely has earthly explanation . an unusual video of mysterious dark objects moving very quickly and erratically over the skies of denver , colo. , has local residents buzzing . fox affiliate kdvr reporter heidi hemmat described `` an unusual object that appears to launch and land in the metro area . `` the federal aviation administration ( faa ) had no record of anything unusual in the skies at the time , either visually or on radar . 'the 'ufos ' appear at least several times a week [ for months ] , we are told , usually around noon to 1 pm . ' - robert sheaffer , ufo researcher the video made news last week when kdvr reported : `` strange objects caught on camera flying over the city and nobody can explain it . we first learned about these sightings when a metro area man , who does not want to be identified , brought us his home video . he captured the images on his digital camera from a hilltop in federal heights looking south toward downtown denver . ... the strangest part is they are flying too fast to see with the naked eye , but when we slowed down the video , several ufos appear . ... aviation expert steve cowell is a former commercial pilot , instructor and faa accident prevention counselor . he thought he would have a logical explanation , until he watched the video . 'that is not an airplane , that is not a helicopter , those are not birds , i ca n't identify it , ' he said . `` there are many obvious holes in the spacecraft explanation , not the least of which is that it 's amazing that no one in denver apparently noticed the extraterrestrial spacecraft launching and landing in the skies over the downtown area in the middle of the day . the most likely explanation ? a bug or insect , probably a fly or bee . assuming that the tv station is not being pranked by the anonymous cameraman , it 's not difficult to see how the insects could fool people . it 's not necessarily that anyone is stupid or gullible ; instead it 's an optical illusion created by the camera representing a three-dimensional object in two dimensions . cases like this illustrate the difficulty of determining the size of objects when there is nothing nearby to judge scale . the unidentified flying objects can either be interpreted as large and moving very quickly a great distance away , or small , moving more slowly , and close to the camera . the images can look exactly the same . if you assume that the objects are at a great distance , then they would have to be large , and flying at speeds ( and with steering abilities ) far beyond anything man-made . however if you realize that the ufos look identical to flying insects , the mystery vanishes . and , of course , the faa tracks aircraft , not insects , which explains why no one saw any trace of them in the skies over denver . skeptical ufo researcher robert sheaffer noted that this is not the first time those flying objects had been filmed : `` the 'ufos ' appear at least several times a week [ for months ] , we are told , usually around noon to 1 pm . most flying insects become more active during the warmest part of the day . `` this is also not the first time that flying insects caught on video have been mistaken for ufos . indeed the denver bugs look identical to ufos in a widely-seen video taken in 2010 at the el bosque air force base in chile . earlier this year that case was widely claimed by bestselling ufo author leslie kean to be among the best pieces of evidence for ufos ever captured on video . if kean is correct , the evidence for extraterrestrials in our skies may be weaker than anyone imagined . `` strange objects caught on camera flying over the city and nobody can explain it . we first learned about these sightings when a metro area man , who does not want to be identified , brought us his home video . he captured the images on his digital camera from a hilltop in federal heights looking south toward downtown denver . ... the strangest part is they are flying too fast to see with the naked eye , but when we slowed down the video , several ufos appear . ... aviation expert steve cowell is a former commercial pilot , instructor and faa accident prevention counselor . he thought he would have a logical explanation , until he watched the video . 'that is not an airplane , that is not a helicopter , those are not birds , i ca n't identify it , ' he said . `` cowell is certainly correct : it is not an airplane nor helicopter , nor birds . he 's also right that he ca n't identify it , though he 'd likely have better luck if he was trained as an entomologist instead of an aviation expert .
n.j. ufo hoaxers get fines , community service . two new jersey men who staged a ufo hoax will have more earthly pursuits , such as picking up trash from the side of the road . a judge fined chris russo of morris plains and joe rudy of chester township $ 250 each and ordered them to perform 50 hours of community service for creating a disturbance . authorities say the pair triggered a flurry of 911 calls when they lit road flares tied to helium balloons and released them in morris county in january and february . the men said they did it to debunk so-called ufo experts . they posted details of their exploits on a web site on april fools ' day . the prosecutor charged them with disorderly conduct , saying the balloons could have interfered with air traffic and posed a potential fire hazard .
norway ufo was out-of-control russian rocket . a spectacular spiral of light was seen over the north of the country on wednesday , prompting theories it was caused by a meteor , the northern lights or even aliens . but now russia has revealed that its latest test-firing of its new intercontinental missile ended in failure at the same time observers witnessed the early morning light show . as well as signaling a major setback for the country s armed forces , the revelation provided a possible explanation for the mysterious display in the skies . russia 's defense ministry refuses to confirme that the lights were caused by its bulava missile , which can be equipped with up to 10 individually targeted nuclear warheads and has a maximum range of 5,000 miles . but defense analyst pavel felgenhauer said the images seen over norway were consistent with a missile failure . `` such lights and clouds appear from time to time when a missile fails in the upper layers of the atmosphere and have been reported before , '' he said . `` at least this failed test made some nice fireworks for the norwegians . `` the botched launch was the twelfth test of the bulava and its eighth failure , which deals another blow to kremlin 's hopes that the sea-based weapon would become a cornerstone of its nuclear arsenal . `` they will have to spend quite a long time trying to make it working , '' said alexander konovalov , the head of the moscow-based institute of strategic assessment . `` that is fraught with very negative consequences , up to the loss of the sea-based component of the russian nuclear forces , '' he said . the ministry said that a government commission was looking into the possible reasons behind the test failure . technology web site gizmodo has created a computer simulation showing how a rocket spiralling out of control could create such a display:
spiraling 'ufo ' was probably a russian missile . a spiraling ball of light spotted in the night sky above the middle east thursday evening was probably a ballistic missile being tested by the russian military , rather than a visitor from outer space . the glowing light 's smoky , swirling descent was witnessed by people in israel , lebanon , armenia , turkey , cyprus , jordan and other middle eastern countries , and footage of the event quickly appeared on youtube . according to msnbc , some witnesses suggested on twitter that the light was a good omen for syria 's revolution , while others worried it was a bad sign for syria , potentially signaling the use of chemical weapons . meanwhile , hundreds of israelis flooded police hotlines with ufo reports , according to the israeli news service ynetnews . but the light was reminiscent of other glowing spirals that have been observed during ballistic missile tests , such as one sighted over norway in 2009. that time , the light was caused by a failed test missile that was releasing burning fuel as it spun . and indeed , later thursday , the russian news agency ria novosti reported that the `` topol '' intercontinental ballistic missile had been successfully test-fired at 9:39 p.m. ( moscow time ) from the astrakhan region in central russia . russian sources said the missile `` accurately hit its target '' in the kazakh firing range , but yigal pat-el , chairman of the israel astronomical association , told ynetnews that the missile `` most likely spun out of control , and its remnants and the fuel was what people saw . `` it could be that the topol missile 's spiraling behavior is a feature , not a malfunction , according to nbc news space analyst james oberg . he said it `` may be associated with guidance , or decoy deploy , or enhancing hardness against u.s. boost-phase antimissile weapons . ``
deep-sea baltic ufo hunt turns up mere rocks . a feature on the floor of the baltic sea that was discovered last summer by swedish treasure hunters is making headlines once again . the latest media coverage draws upon an hour-long radio interview with peter lindberg , head of the ocean x team ( which made the `` discovery '' ) , in which lindberg delivers a string of cryptic and titillating statements about the `` strange '' and `` mysterious '' seafloor object his team has been exploring for a year . lindberg discusses various possibilities for what the object might be : `` it has these very strange stair formations , and if it is constructed , it must be constructed tens of thousands of years ago before the ice age , '' he said in the radio interview . ( the peak of the most recent ice age occurred some 20,000 years ago . ) `` if this is atlantis , that would be quite amazing , '' he said . atlantis is a mythical underwater city referred to in ancient legends . lindberg acknowledges that the object could instead be a natural formation , such as a meteorite that penetrated the ice during the ice age , or an underwater volcano ; however , he gives the impression that scientists are baffled by it . geologists , for example , have supposedly told him the object `` can not be a volcano . `` [ image album : baltic sea 'anomaly ' ] 'most of the samples ocean-x has brought up from the sea bottom are granites and gneisses and sandstones . ' - volker br chert , associate professor of geology also adding titillation , lindberg says a documentary is being made about the seafloor anomaly the location of which he has not disclosed and he 's saving some juicy details for the footage . `` we 're not telling everything , '' he said . `` we will reveal some quite interesting things in the documentary . `` the divers recently gave samples of stone from the object to volker br chert , an associate professor of geology at stockholm university . swedish tabloids quote br chert as saying : `` i was surprised when i researched the material i found a great black stone that could be a volcanic rock . my hypothesis is that this object , this structure was formed during the ice age many thousands of years ago . `` in other words , an expert appears to back up their claims that this seafloor object is unexplained , and perhaps is an atlantis-like ancient building complex . to double check , life 's little mysteries consulted that expert . turns out , neither he , nor any of the other experts contacted about the baltic sea object , think there is anything mysterious about it . `` it 's good to hear critical voices about this 'baltic sea mystery , ' '' br chert wrote in an email . `` what has been generously ignored by the ocean-x team is that most of the samples they have brought up from the sea bottom are granites and gneisses and sandstones . `` these , he explains , are exactly what one would expect to see in a glacial basin , which is what the baltic sea is a region carved out by glacial ice long ago . along with the mundane rocks , the divers also gave him a single loose piece of basaltic rock , a type of rock that forms from hardened lava . this is out of place on the seafloor , but not unusual . `` because the whole northern baltic region is so heavily influenced by glacial thawing processes , both the feature and the rock samples are likely to have formed in connection with glacial and postglacial processes , '' he wrote . `` possibly these rocks were transported there by glaciers . `` glaciers often have rocks embedded in them . at the end of the ice age , when glaciers across northern europe melted , the rocks inside them dropped to the earth 's surface , leaving rocky deposits all over the place . these are sometimes called glacial erratics or balancing rocks . [ gallery of the weirdest balancing rocks ] lindberg and the ocean x team did not respond to a request for comment on the glacial deposit theory . aside from a widely-reproduced illustration recently created by a graphics artist in which the baltic seafloor object is rendered as a beautiful , atlantis-like archaeological site , there has only ever been one actual image of the baltic sea object : the original sonar scan image captured by the divers last summer , in which the object resembles a crashed ufo spaceship . but experts told us that sonar image should be disregarded . `` the sonar image has numerous artifacts in it that make it difficult to interpret , and i would not place too much confidence in any interpretation until a better processing is done and the details of the type of sonar and particulars are provided , '' said seabed sonar-scanning expert dan fornari , a marine geologist at the woods hole oceanographic institution in massachusetts . `` i 'm saying the dataare lacking in resolution , detail and quantification . `` the expert analysis suggests this is just a glacial deposit that the ocean x team `` discovered '' in a low-resolution sonar scan . widespread media coverage , fame and a worldwide internet following have since ensued . lindberg laments the fact that no organizations will sponsor his investigation . some organizations have supposedly told him funding the dives is n't worth their time because the anomaly `` might be something very unexplainable . `` he asks people to support his and his fellow divers ' work by purchasing apparel from the ocean x website .
phoenix 'ufo ' revealed as nasa experiment . earlier this week a mysterious , glowing teardrop-shaped object was seen high in the sky above phoenix . wptv news channel 5 asked its readers , what was that floating ( sometimes stationary ) bright , glowing object hovering over the valley monday evening ? did you see it ? some thought it was a ufo , a weather balloon or even an alien spaceship . video : top 5 ufo video hoax tips eventually the national weather service was asked about it , and their response poured cold water on conspiracy theories about top-secret military craft and extraterrestrial visitation . the strange sight has nothing to do with ufos or aliens . instead it s a hasp 643n a high altitude student platform balloon sent up to research things like wind patterns and air quality . it s a project of the columbia scientific balloon facility , which according to its web site , launches large , unmanned , high-altitude research balloons and recovers the experiments they carry for nasa and universities around the world . though the columbia balloon facility is located in palestine , texas , the former-ufo hasp balloon was launched from fort sumner , n.m. not far from roswell , site of a famous 1947 crash of either a cold war spy balloon project or an alien spacecraft depending on whom you believe . this is only the latest of many purported ufo reports near or over the city of phoenix . in late 2011 , for example , four bright lights were seen and videotaped during a high school football game in scottsdale . the strange lights , which were seen by hundreds of people and videotaped by at least two of them , seemed to move slowly in the sky , sometimes blinking randomly . the entire sighting lasted for about a minute and a half . the video was posted to youtube , where within days it became one of the top stories on yahoo news , sparked a national mystery and garnered over 50,000 views . news : mysterious kentucky ufo explained the mystery was soon solved when a local reporter identified the mysterious lights as & gtfour members of a skydiving team , the arizona skyhawks , who jumped with bright magnesium flares for a halloween show . in 2008 , another set of mysterious lights were sighted . hundreds of phoenix residents reported four bright red lights in the sky at about 8 p.m. those turned out to be a hoax created by road flares tied to helium balloons . robert sheaffer , a ufo investigator with skeptical inquirer magazine and author of the `` bad ufos blog , told discovery news , it s remarkable how so many people , when they see lights in the sky , immediately jump to the conclusion that they might be seeing ( an alien spacecraft ) in reality there are many different possible explanations for lights in the sky , all of them more likely than alien visitors . it s a good reminder that just because one or more people can t identify something in the sky doesn t mean that it s unknown or unexplainable . indeed , there may be more ufo sightings still to come . another half-dozen hasp balloon launches are slated for this month , and depending on weather patterns and where you live may end up in the skies over your hometown .
nasa solves 'ufo ' mystery outside international space station . it s an identified flying object . on monday morning , 220 or so miles about the earth , nasa astronaut chris cassidy looked out the window to see a mysterious object drifting by . cassidy reached out to mission control about the strange item , which was drifting lazily in the emptiness of space . according to a narrator on a clip from nasa tv , which shows the object passing near the progress 52 module attached to the station , it lost the unidentified tag . earlier this morning , chris cassidy had noted an object that was floating past the station near the station s progress 52 cargo ship , said the nasa tv narrator . that object has been identified by russian flight controllers as an antenna cover from the zvezda service module . the zvezda service module was the first fully russian contribution to the international space station and served as the early cornerstone for the first human habitation of the station , according to nasa . it was launched atop a proton rocket from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan . the module provides station living quarters , life support systems , electrical power distribution , data processing systems , flight control systems and propulsion systems . it also provides a communications system that includes remote command capabilities from ground flight controllers . its antenna must be awfully cold .
uk shut down ufo desk after finding no threat : files . britain 's defence ministry shut down its ufo unit four years ago after concluding that extra-terrestrials likely did not exist , and in any case did not pose a threat , previously secret files released friday showed . the ministry of defence ( mod ) closed its hotline in 2009 despite a trebling of reported sightings of unidentified flying objects ( ufos ) that year , many of them near national landmarks . in a briefing for then defence minister bob ainsworth , civil servant carl mantell said the ufo desk was using up increasing amounts of staff time but had `` no valuable defence output '' . he wrote in a memo that in more than 50 years , `` no ufo sighting reported to ( mod ) has ever revealed anything to suggest an extra-terrestrial presence or military threat to the uk '' . it added : `` the level of resources diverted to this task is increasing in response to a recent upsurge in reported sightings , diverting staff from more valuable defence-related activities . `` the national archives files reveal details of sightings recorded in the two years before the ufo desk was disbanded , including those around the houses of parliament and stonehenge . between 2000 to 2007 , the mod received an average of 150 reports a year , but 520 sightings were recorded in the 11 months to november 2009 , according to a briefing in the files . officials said one possible reason for the surge could have been the trend for releasing chinese lanterns , which appear like floating lights in the sky . many sightings were made in the summer months by people out walking their dogs , having barbecues and , in one case , relaxing in a hot tub .
drone mistaken for ufo , creates panic on dc highway . people in the d.c. area are buzzing after pictures began popping up online showing what many believed to be a 'ufo ' in transport along the capitol beltway , myfoxdc reported . the spotting took place around 11:00 p.m. wednesday when drivers first saw the craft being hauled on a flatbed truck on i-270 , then on i-495 . maryland state police confirmed that the strange craft was actually a drone aircraft made by northrup grumman that was being transported from west virginia to patuxent naval air station in maryland . it was n't the first time aircraft being transported had been mistaken for 'ufos ' . last year , residents of cowley county , kansas mistook a similar flying machine . defensetech.org reported last year that engineers practice aircraft carrier take-offs and landings with the drone on a strip of runway at patuxent that 's painted to resemble a carrier 's flight deck .
ufos over china ? not quite , analyst says . those probably were not ufos that hovered over china recently , a massachusetts institute of technology analyst said . the images of the ufos have caused quite a stir in china and on blogs around the world . but many of the images appear to be faked with the software program photoshop and the ones that were not faked seem to depict the launch of a chinese ballistic missile , said geoffrey forden , an mit weapons analyst . forden , who also specializes in russian and chinese space systems , published his analysis on a blog called `` arms control wonk . `` in the analysis , forden used scientific theories to examine the images of the flying object that he felt were not created with photoshop . `` it seems to me that a df-21 ( missile ) launch somewhere near jiuquan and aimed at a point somewhere in the eastern gobi desert is the most likely cause of this 'ufo ' '' , forden wrote . chinese officials have been looking into the reports about ufos . they have said they were trying to determine whether the objects were private or military aircraft , rocket flares , reflection in the sky or something else . the first sighting occurred at hangzhou 's xiaoshan airport , in the eastern part of the country , according to the state-controlled xinhua news agency . eighteen flights were delayed or rerouted and operations shut down after twinkling lights were spotted above the terminal around 9 p.m. july 7 , the agency said . according to xinhua , speculation has centered on a private aircraft . the state-run china daily quoted a source saying the object had a military connection . purported photos of the unworldly object have appeared online , on youtube and on television news shows . meanwhile , the shanghai daily reported a ufo appeared above the city of chongqing a day later .
nasa debunks mysterious triangular 'ufo ' . once again , alien conspiracy theorists have attempted to use publicly available nasa images to prove that the space agency must be engaging in an elaborate ufo cover-up . and , once again , they 've been foiled by the laws of physics . this time , they called attention to peculiar new footage captured by a telescope onboard nasa 's stereo-b spacecraft one of a pair of probes parked on either side of the sun which , together , provide a 360-degree view of the inner solar system . the footage shows venus , earth and , on the opposite side of the field-of-view , a mysterious triangular object headed our way . `` comparing it for size to the planetary objects that are seen in this telescope , if my calculations are correct , that thing is enormous , '' said youtube user `` beepeeoildisaster '' in his video commentary on the footage , which was captured dec. 27 -29. talk of a cover-up quickly followed when , a few days later , nasa scientists updated the stereo website to display newer images . this is not the first time alien hunters have found what they believe to be enormous ufos in images captured by the stereo probes . [ mysterious planet-size object spotted near mercury ] but this time , the team of scientists who work with data from the probes decided to address the claim directly . in a post on the stereo website , the researchers offered up an explanation of the triangular feature in the december footage . the researchers say it 's no more than a trick of the light . `` the answer lies on the exact opposite side of the image , '' the scientists wrote . `` at the same time as this strange-looking feature starts being visible , the very bright planet venus enters the [ telescopic camera 's ] field-of-view from the lower left . `` the scientists note that venus and the triangle , opposite each other across the middle of the camera plane , stay in step as they move . `` this is not a coincidence . the strange-looking geometrical 'object ' is actually an internal reflection of the planet venus within the telescope optics . this effect has been seen many times before . `` in this optical effect , incoming light reflects back and forth off lenses and mirrors inside the telescope ; the shape of artifacts produced by this scattered light usually triangles and circles of various sizes depends on the relative orientations of those lenses and mirrors . another example of internal reflection , this time of light from planet earth , can be seen in a stereo-b image from may 2007 . more examples of internal reflection and other optical and data-processing artifacts are displayed on the scientists ' `` image artifacts '' web page , along with explanations of the various effects .
'ufo ' lights up brazil skies . a ufo spied in the skies over sao paulo has all of brazil buzzing . the amateur footage , shown on brazilian tv station g1 , shows blurry footage of a disc-shaped object hovering in the clouds for a minute or so -- before disappearing in a bright flash of light , followed by a trail of colorful bursts . but is it an alien visitation , or merely the latest in a storied tradition of forgeries ? g1 's anchors explain that two passersby saw the object as they were driving in their car , near the town of agudos in sao paulo state . they hopped out of the car to shoot the video with their handheld camera . according to the tv station , the cinematographers reported the earth shaking at about the same time the object vanishes in a blast of light , noting that other people reported the earth moving in the same general area . according to the u.s. geological survey 's earthquake hazards program , there have been no earthquakes in the area . chile was rocked by a few earthquakes in recent days , notably a 6.8 magnitude temblor on february 11. video-editing expert philip cavaca told g1 that the film was a well-made montage -- but a hoax nonetheless . `` it can be seen in one frame , '' he told the station . `` when the truck goes by , you can tell that the ufo was moved , which is un-noticeable to the naked eye , '' he said . according to cavaca , by freezing the image you can see the exact frame in which the `` ufo '' alters . the station did not reveal the identity of the videographers , but did say that the video was the talk of the town in sao paulo .
'ufo sightings ' could soon explode , thanks to venus . planetariums , observatories , weather offices and perhaps even police stations should be prepared to receive a bevy of inquiries during the next couple of weeks concerning a strange `` ufo '' that will soon be making appearances low in the eastern sky just before sunrise . the unusual lateness of sunrise may add to the confusion for skywatchers , since it coincides with the sudden arrival of the bright sky apparition . but there 's no need to be alarmed . that bright light in the sky is only the planet venus , which returns to visibility wednesday , nov. 3. this sky map shows where to look to spot venus on that date . venus shines bright venus ' bright arrival comes in the midst of likely darkness for those who are heading out to work and school in the morning . [ gallery : photos of venus ] this is an artifact of daylight saving time . since daylight saving time was extended into the first week of november in 2008 , sunrises at this time occur later than even in the dead of winter . indeed , for some parts of the country , the sun does n't rise until after 8 a.m. local time . that means that countless millions are starting their days with the stars as their morning companion . perhaps you 've driven to work under the cover of darkness , or waited at a bus or train station and have looked around and gotten acquainted with the starry background . if you 've been glancing toward the east-southeast part of the sky , you probably have n't noticed anything particularly noteworthy or eye-catching . morning sky change looms but it will all change quite suddenly on the morning of nov. 3. on that morning , about a half-hour before sunrise , a dazzling silvery-white star-like object will suddenly appear just above the east-southeast horizon . it 's likely to take more than a few people by surprise , since it simply was n't there on previous mornings . and , on following mornings , it will appear noticeably higher on the horizon . this is venus , beginning a spectacular morning apparition . it climbs nearly 10 degrees high ( a portion of the sky that can be covered by your clenched fist held at arm 's length ) at sunrise on nov. 6 the final morning of daylight saving time . clocks will be set back one hour the following day and sunrises will come an hour earlier , but by then , venus will be firmly established as a dazzling harbinger of sunrise . venus will be 20 degrees high at sunrise on nov. 16 , and 27 degrees on nov. 25 as seen from northern hemisphere locations around 40 degrees north latitude . as november ends , venus rises a full three hours before the sun and hangs almost 30 degrees high at sunrise . venus will brighten impressively throughout the month . for early morning commuters , who will likely wonder about this brilliant luminary bursting upon the predawn scene , venus will no doubt call attention to itself . venus ' quick transition some might wonder why venus will become so quickly established as a dazzling morning entity compared with those occasions when it seems to take many days or weeks sometimes even months to transition into the evening sky . the difference lies in venus ' position relative to the earth . when venus moves from the morning sky into the evening sky ( called `` superior conjunction '' ) it 's located on the opposite side of the sun relative to earth . located at about 160 million miles from earth on these occasions , venus is moving at its slowest speed against the background stars . what 's more , it is also moving in the same apparent direction against the stars as the sun to the east . so in the days leading up to and then even after superior conjunction , venus continues to languish in the bright glare of the sun . finally and very gradually venus moves just far enough away from the sun to be glimpsed for a short time , low near the western horizon shortly after sunset . perhaps after a number of weeks , the planey climbs high enough to become conspicuous to all in our evening sky . but in a morning transition , things are much different . at inferior conjunction ( which is where venus was on oct. 28 ) , the planet passed between earth and the sun . it was also only about 25 million miles from earth more than six times closer than it is at superior conjunction . so venus is moving much faster against the background stars . and , most importantly , as seen from our earthly vantage point , the sun and venus appear to be moving in opposite directions . while the sun plods along toward the east , venus is racing away to the west , which allows it to literally appear to `` bolt '' into the morning sky and become readily established as a predawn beacon over the span of just a week or two , as opposed to many weeks in the evening . and lastly , because venus is so much nearer , morning apparitions begin with the planet already near its peak brilliance . crescent venus this phase of venus looks most remarkable through a telescope , especially early in november . observers with optical aid will be treated to the marvel of a huge ( close to an arc minute long ) , but wire-thin , crescent ( only a few percent illuminated ) when venus is first sighted after inferior conjunction . you can even see the crescent with 7x50 binoculars , and some folks with exceptional eyesight might even be able to perceive it without optical aid . so if you hear about any strange ufo sightings being made in the early morning hours during the coming weeks , at least you now know what it likely is .
