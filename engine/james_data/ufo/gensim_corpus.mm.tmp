widely examined cases on record skeptics ranged from the deputies who first interviewed the men to an author who sought to poke holes in the story and parker himself has had conflicting thoughts about whether he was visited by aliens or demons parker now 58 was 18 when he went fishing with hickson on tranquil thursday night after work as they dangled their lines without much luck the two said ufo with blue lights swooped down they told of zipping noise made by the object hickson then 42 said three creatures with leathery gray skin and claws he thought they were robots took them by the forearms and levitated them aboard the craft he said something that looked like large floating eye appeared to examine him parker says he was conscious but paralyzed they gave thorough mean thorough examination to me just like any doctor would he said and then they were back on the shore where it all began the ufo was gone and parker said they tried to collect themselves hickson needed three shots of liquor from bottle in his car to calm his nerves before deciding to report what happened at the jackson county sheriff department deputies initially suspected both men were drunk glenn ryder who still works for the sheriff office said he laughed at the report but met with the men parker and hickson stuck to their story after the formal interview deputies left hickson and parker together in room with hidden tape recorder hoping to catch them in lie me and the other investigator got up and left to let them talk to see if they were going to say we got them fooled but they did ryder said they were really concerned on the tape hickson tells parker it scared me to death too son you ca get over it in lifetime jesus christ have mercy do know what happened to them ryder said was there with them but know you do fake fear and they were fearful they were fearful the next afternoon the story was splashed across the front pages of newspapers in pascagoula and gulfport overnight pascagoula became magnet for news reporters and ufo investigators widespread interest in ufos began in the 1940s with an incident at roswell in which ufo enthusiasts believe the government got its hands on

hickson and parker report was hoax in his book ufos explained he noted hickson changed some details of his story and claimed polygraph operator whose test hickson passed was up to the task parker later passed lie detector test himself hickson would go on to appear on talk shows give lectures and interviews and book in 1983 titled ufo contact at pascagoula he reported three more encounters in 1974 and said the aliens communicated to him that they were peaceful the only thing he wanted to do was let everybody know we were not alone said eddie hickson his son he did care if you believed him or not if you wanted to listen by gum he tell you he could never understand why he was chosen the younger hickson added but he never once told me that he wished it had never happened never parker said

ufos eyed nukes force personnel say seven former air force personnel gathered in washington monday to recount ufo sightings over nuclear weapons facilities in decades past accounts that ufo researcher says show extraterrestrial beings are interested in the world nuclear arms race and may be sending humans message at news conference at the national press club the six former officers and one man recalled either personal sightings or reports from subordinates and others of ufos hovering over nuclear missile silos or nuclear weapons storage areas in the 1960s and three of the former air force officers though they hadn seen the ufos themselves told reporters that ufos hovering over silos around montana malmstrom air force base in 1967 appeared to have temporarily deactivated some of the nuclear missiles much of the testimony already has appeared in books websites and elsewhere but ufo researcher and author robert hastings who organized the news conference said the time has come for the government to acknowledge the ufo visits believe these gentlemen believe that this planet is being visited by beings from another world who for whatever reason have taken an interest in the nuclear arms race which began at the end of world war ii said hastings who added that more than 120 former military personnel have told him about ufos visiting nuclear sites regarding the missile shutdown incidents my opinion is that whoever are aboard these craft are sending signal to both washington and moscow among others that we are playing with fire that the possession and threatened use of nuclear weapons potentially threatens the human race and the integrity of the planetary environment he said former air force capt robert salas who has written book about the montana incidents said he was underground when ufo hovered over his missile silo in march 1967 and therefore couldn see it he said one of his guards above ground told him red glowing object about 30 feet in diameter was hovering just above the front gate of the facility in an isolated area far from malmstrom and just as called my commander our missiles began going into what called condition or unlaunchable essentially they were disabled while this object was still hovering over out site salas said salas and others said the military urged them at the time not to talk about the incidents retired charles halt recalled seeing ufos over the woods near royal air force stations bentwaters and woodbridge in eastern england in december he and security personnel were investigating reports of strange lights just outside one of the bases all through the forest was bright glowing object he said monday the best way can describe it it looked like an eye with bright red with dark center it appeared to be winking it was shedding something like molten metal was dripping off it it silently moved through the trees avoiding any contact it bobbed up and down and at one point it actually approached us we tried to get closer it receded out into the field beyond the forest and silently exploded into five white objects gone so we went out into the field looking for any evidence because something had been apparently falling off it and we find nothing he said he recalled subsequently seeing other objects in the sky including one that stopped about feet overhead and sent down concentrated beam at our feet no one was harmed the best way can equate it is sort of laser beam we stood there in awe was this warning was this an attempt to communicate was this weapon or just probe he said at about the same time he was hearing radio reports from base personnel that beams from some of the objects were falling into or near the weapons storage area in staff meeting later general decided it happened off base so it british affair halt recalled in other words they were loathe to get involved the air force investigated ufos from 1948 to 1969 under program eventually called project blue book the service on its website says the project concluded that no ufo reported investigated and evaluated by the air force has ever given any indication of threat to our national security it also says there has been no evidence that sightings categorized as are extraterrestrial vehicles salas said the ufo phenomenon is real not imaginary there is current excessive secrecy in our government surrounding this phenomenon he said reporter asked how many of the former military personnel subscribed to hastings theory that the message of extraterrestrials is that humans should get rid of nuclear weapons and how many of them believed that we should get rid of nukes of the seven it appeared that only salas raised his hand

silicon valley ceo turns ufo evangelist idg joe firmage does not seem crazy his words do not echo like the proclamations of zealot but rather are delivered in controlled deliberate boardroom fashion they sound like the words of man who was forming strategy for building web sites one day and forming strategy for evolution the next somehow firmage manner makes the progression seem natural joe firmage wants you to believe what he believes to wit you are homo sapien animal sitting at the top of an clump of geology staring into an electronic communications system called internet revolutions around this globe since the birth of man named jesus that more accurate picture of you in the eyes of the cosmos right now joe firmage says that without blinking joseph firmage 28 founded usweb leading internet consulting firm in like his previous ventures the company prospered wildly for fiscal 1998 usweb posted revenue of 228 million 100 increase over the previous year during that year of intense growth joe firmage was moonlighting working on the kairos project web site and book due this summer about human evolution and extraterrestrials word got out in january firmage posted his manifesto called the truth which evokes both star trek and the new testament in the manifesto firmage asserts that extraterrestrials not only have visited us but also have influenced our technological development few days later he resigned so is he crackpot as the companies merged shortly before firmage left board member gary reischel recently pronounced him summing up what he heard from colleagues and investors or is he maverick entrepreneur with disturbing ideas who is paying with his credibility for the strength of his convictions quiet certainty joe firmage does not look like man who spent million of his own dollars researching extraterrestrials in tony los gatos in living room almost too small for its opulent furniture he speaks without flourish with pregnant pauses and sustained as much as with bold words he wears discreetly trimmed beard and is dressed casually as per the uniform of silicon valley executives including mandatory cell phone which periodically interrupts an interview out front in the driveway cardboard jesus hangs from the rearview mirror of his red corvette firmage is both savvy and candid about all the attention the world is paying him been very open to the media for 10 years now in business context he says but given nobody reason to question my sanity until six months ago just starting to get the pr structure to deal with the media when he first published his manifesto the news stories tended toward predictable snickering but firmage says he believes it beginning to shift in the right direction rolling stone is doing good piece on us time already done something be on dateline nbc just spent the whole day with abc news how does he expect those tv interviews to go everything can and will be used against me he laughs early achiever firmage was born and raised in salt lake city where his family belonged to the church of jesus christ of saints it very cosmic thing he says of the mormon church after finishing high school in mere two years scholarship in physics led him to the university of utah firmage left college in 1989 after his sophomore year to form his first venture serius which began as macintosh program for his mother greeting card business and quickly grew into database software company result within six months firmage says serius closed million in revenue in 1993 firmage sold the company to novell for 24 million and vice presidency in 1995 he left to found usweb according to novell public relations manager jonathan cohen the company considered firmage valued contributor we would comment on his beliefs or cultural activities the real deal am convinced that the ufo phenomenon is absolutely legitimate firmage says have sat across the table from people whose credibility is unimpeachable people who have described to him in great detail their experiences as alien abductees he says asked to mention names he replies ca the cultural activities cohen mentions can be traced firmage says to vision he had early one morning in 1997 shortly before usweb initial public offering mysterious figure clad in white hovered over his bed he recalls the two shared brief conversation about travel when asked by the visitor why he should be given the chance to travel in space firmage said because willing to die for it the following year was the busiest time of my professional life he says held job at usweb with kairos the ufo project growing to four to six hours per day had simple system daytime usweb evening kairos year after the visit firmage posted his manuscript online media flood followed then came investor jitters for the record chose to step down firmage says and off the record chose to step down that the truth was not forced out now had not chosen to step down could well have been forced out been 10 years in this valley know how the game is played is there no room for visions like his in silicon valley would like the answer to be yes but right now no maybe that why firmage claims there are several silicon valley leaders hiding their own belief in extraterrestrials he declines several times to mention names why the need to remain quiet well look what happened to me man of principle frankly admire the guy says author and columnist robert cringely in world filled with weasels who call themselves entrepreneurs and who will corrupt their business plan to fit whatever is this week hot technology firmage stands out as man of principle and now out of the boardroom firmage is free to discuss those principles can say things could never say when at the helm of usweb he says every single executive of public company has to live that way he says steve jobs and bill gates are exceptions who have measure of freedom that anybody just one notch down on that ladder does not have one of firmage goals he says is to make things that have not been permitted to be spoken in open company speakable things that deal with anomalies things that deal with spirituality things like energy and gravitational propulsion those controversial theories of physics underpin firmage belief in travel energy refers to theory that energy can be created from nothing rather than matter gravitational propulsion is based on the concept that the force of gravity can not only be harnessed but also engineered combined the two provide the foundation for spacecraft capable of warp speeds firmage beliefs have backers john peterson futurist and head of the arlington institute nonprofit research group in arlington is adamant about energy there no question but that it real and charles ostman senior fellow at the san institute for global futures says that in 25 to 50 years we probably will have things like antigravity travel continuum manipulation all the usual precursors to getting around the universe not all scientists agree in fact not all seekers of extraterrestrials agree dan wertheimer director of the university of california at berkeley search for intelligence program calls firmage ideas pretty wacko you be to find any scientist that thought there was an ounce of credibility in his ideas visionary or crackpot you also be to find silicon valley ceo who does drone on about vision and evolution and progress if nothing else joe firmage story is the story of what happens when the vision becomes intensely personal when public relations buffers melt away and the board runs for cover it impossible not to wonder at firmage motivations is this story about yearning for liberation from the corporate structure when usweb and cks merged firmage was not named ceo of the combined company is firmage after piece of history is this publicity trick plan to get richer after all that cell phone keeps ringing or is this as simple as one man telling his version of the truth and paying for it dearly what happens in the history of world when its most advanced beings for the first time gain the power to break through its own gravity well joe firmage asks tell you what it called it called birth if earth is living being and we are created by the earth and we one day gain that power the power to touch the fabric of itself and use it tap it to voyage is that not literally birth and is not the history of humanity an incredible drum roll to the opening of the first real frontier that the vision that see

mysterious over kentucky explained google it is cheekily said knows everything even apparently the origin of an unidentified flying object on 16 2012 residents of pike county looked high in the sky to find strange sight amateur astronomer allen epling described it to local reporter as looking like two fluorescent bulbs side by side parallel shining very brightly it would get so bright they would seem to merge and you could see it very clearly with the naked eye epling said then it would dim down almost invisible it was anything recognized definitely not an airplane and never seen helicopter that looked like that epling was the only one who noticed police in kentucky virginia and tennessee got phone calls from concerned citizens calls were made to nearby airports but government officials could shed no light on it the unidentified flying object estimated to have reached an altitude of feet remained more or less stationary for hours suggesting that it was tethered to the ground somehow or hovering under its own power things most often mistaken for ufos and now the origin of the bright bulbs has been found explanations and speculations alien spacecraft were of course suspected the most likely explanation balloon of some sort was floated but led to further mystery and shadowy speculation what entity placed it there and what was its purpose was it spying on unwitting americans or was it sampling or even creating chemtrails those lines in the sky that resemble normal airplane contrails but are suspected of being anything from extraterrestrial signals to experiments to machinery many thought chemical agents were involved which raises the question of what possible purpose the chemtrails would serve as bob carroll notes in his book the skeptic dictionary wiley 2003 any biological or chemical agents released at feet or above would be absolutely impossible to control making any measurement of effects on the ground nearly impossible such an exercise would be pointless unless you just wanted to pollute the atmosphere besides that the fact that the government did know or depending on your point of view claimed not to know what the object was simply fueled the speculation obviously whatever was that big and high up in the sky was not put there by hobbyist and if no one at the air force or pentagon truly knew what it was perhaps private company or maybe even foreign power was behind it the reports and news faded away but the mysterious object hung like question mark in the sky secret revealed now an article in wired magazine has revealed the secret behind the mysterious craft tech endeavor project loon the people in pike county were witnessing test of project loon breathtakingly ambitious plan to bring the internet to huge swath of humanity via thousands of balloons floating some feet above earth wrote wired steven levy the balloon stayed aloft for 11 days before reaching canada levy reports the project loon balloons while providing fodder for ufo websites and conspiracy theorists travel on the edge of space designed to connect people in rural and remote areas help fill coverage gaps and bring people back online after disasters according to the project website the balloons would circle the planet floating in rings about 12 miles 19 kilometers above earth in the stratosphere about twice the altitude at which commercial airplanes fly people connect to the balloon network using special internet antenna attached to their building the signal bounces from balloon to balloon then to the global internet back on earth the website reads the result internet access so the mysterious ufo was indeed the result of technologically advanced civilization but it seems that civilization comes in peace and is here to help us or at least provide affordable to rural populations
dennis kucinich ufo comments prove he nuts now know he not going to be president so there is an argument for not giving dennis kucinich kick in the pants but with apologies to the congressman in advance afraid must about 24 hours after democratic presidential candidate dennis kucinich pronounced president bush crazy for even thinking there might have to be war with iran the ohio congressman was asked if in fact while visiting with shirley maclaine he had actually seen ufo remember this is guy who feels free to say bush is crazy one day and admit something the next day that many if not most people think proves person is crazy if you seen ufos you probably should go around calling other people nuts if you admit to seeing ufo martians space creatures big foot and all the rest you are by definition on the defensive against charge of craziness the congressman does eat meat perhaps that is an explanation and the rest of you who have seen ufos please do send angry it not going to make any difference still think are crazy oh and by the way it is just bush who thinks we might be forced into conflict with iran the french president said so publicly at his speech couple months ago and even muslim states are recognizing this might be reality it bad but it not crazy however now we know who actually is crazy that my word
denver likely has earthly explanation an unusual video of mysterious dark objects moving very quickly and erratically over the skies of denver has local residents buzzing fox affiliate kdvr reporter heidi hemmat described an unusual object that appears to launch and land in the metro area the federal aviation administration faa had no record of anything unusual in the skies at the time either visually or on radar appear at least several times week for months we are told usually around noon to pm robert sheaffer ufo researcher the video made news last week when kdvr reported strange objects caught on camera flying over the city and nobody can explain it we first learned about these sightings when metro area man who does not want to be identified brought us his home video he captured the images on his digital camera from hilltop in federal heights looking south toward downtown denver the strangest part is they are flying too fast to see with the naked eye but when we slowed down the video several ufos appear aviation expert steve cowell is former commercial pilot instructor and faa accident prevention counselor he thought he would have logical explanation until he watched the video is not an airplane that is not helicopter those are not birds ca identify it he said there are many obvious holes in the spacecraft explanation not the least of which is that it amazing that no one in denver apparently noticed the extraterrestrial spacecraft launching and landing in the skies over the downtown area in the middle of the day the most likely explanation bug or insect probably fly or bee assuming that the tv station is not being pranked by the anonymous cameraman it not difficult to see how the insects could fool people it not necessarily that anyone is stupid or gullible instead it an optical illusion created by the camera representing object in two dimensions cases like this illustrate the difficulty of determining the size of objects when there is nothing nearby to judge scale the unidentified flying objects can either be interpreted as large and moving very quickly great distance away or small moving more slowly and close to the camera the images can look exactly the same if you assume that the objects are at great distance then they would have to be large and flying at speeds and with steering abilities far beyond anything however if you realize that the ufos look identical to flying insects the mystery vanishes and of course the faa tracks aircraft not insects which explains why no one saw any trace of them in the skies over denver skeptical ufo researcher robert sheaffer noted that this is not the first time those flying objects had been filmed the appear at least several times week for months we are told usually around noon to pm most flying insects become more active during the warmest part of the day this is also not the first time that flying insects caught on video have been mistaken for ufos indeed the denver bugs look identical to ufos in video taken in 2010 at the el bosque air force base in chile earlier this year that case was widely claimed by bestselling ufo author leslie kean to be among the best pieces of evidence for ufos ever captured on video if kean is correct the evidence for extraterrestrials in our skies may be weaker than anyone imagined strange objects caught on camera flying over the city and nobody can explain it we first learned about these sightings when metro area man who does not want to be identified brought us his home video he captured the images on his digital camera from hilltop in federal heights looking south toward downtown denver the strangest part is they are flying too fast to see with the naked eye but when we slowed down the video several ufos appear aviation expert steve cowell is former commercial pilot instructor and faa accident prevention counselor he thought he would have logical explanation until he watched the video is not an airplane that is not helicopter those are not birds ca identify it he said cowell is certainly correct it is not an airplane nor helicopter nor birds he also right that he ca identify it though he likely have better luck if he was trained as an entomologist instead of an aviation expert

norway ufo was russian rocket spectacular spiral of light was seen over the north of the country on wednesday prompting theories it was caused by meteor the northern lights or even aliens but now russia has revealed that its latest of its new intercontinental missile ended in failure at the same time observers witnessed the early morning light show as well as signaling major setback for the country armed forces the revelation provided possible explanation for the mysterious display in the skies russia defense ministry refuses to confirme that the lights were caused by its bulava missile which can be equipped with up to 10 individually targeted nuclear warheads and has maximum range of miles but defense analyst pavel felgenhauer said the images seen over norway were consistent with missile failure such lights and clouds appear from time to time when missile fails in the upper layers of the atmosphere and have been reported before he said at least this failed test made some nice fireworks for the norwegians the botched launch was the twelfth test of the bulava and its eighth failure which deals another blow to kremlin hopes that the weapon would become cornerstone of its nuclear arsenal they will have to spend quite long time trying to make it working said alexander konovalov the head of the institute of strategic assessment that is fraught with very negative consequences up to the loss of the component of the russian nuclear forces he said the ministry said that government commission was looking into the possible reasons behind the test failure technology web site gizmodo has created computer simulation showing how rocket spiralling out of control could create such
spiraling was probably russian missile spiraling ball of light spotted in the night sky above the middle east thursday evening was probably ballistic missile being tested by the russian military rather than visitor from outer space the glowing light smoky swirling descent was witnessed by people in israel lebanon armenia turkey cyprus jordan and other middle eastern countries and footage of the event quickly appeared on youtube according to msnbc some witnesses suggested on twitter that the light was good omen for syria revolution while others worried it was bad sign for syria potentially signaling the use of chemical weapons meanwhile hundreds of israelis flooded police hotlines with ufo reports according to the israeli news service ynetnews but the light was reminiscent of other glowing spirals that have been observed during ballistic missile tests such as one sighted over norway in that time the light was caused by failed test missile that was releasing burning fuel as it spun and indeed later thursday the russian news agency ria novosti reported that the topol intercontinental ballistic missile had been successfully at moscow time from the astrakhan region in central russia russian sources said the missile accurately hit its target in the kazakh firing range but yigal chairman of the israel astronomical association told ynetnews that the missile most likely spun out of control and its remnants and the fuel was what people saw it could be that the topol missile spiraling behavior is feature not malfunction according to nbc news space analyst james oberg he said it may be associated with guidance or decoy deploy or enhancing hardness against antimissile weapons
baltic ufo hunt turns up mere rocks feature on the floor of the baltic sea that was discovered last summer by swedish treasure hunters is making headlines once again the latest media coverage draws upon an radio interview with peter lindberg head of the ocean team which made the discovery in which lindberg delivers string of cryptic and titillating statements about the strange and mysterious seafloor object his team has been exploring for year lindberg discusses various possibilities for what the object might be it has these very strange stair formations and if it is constructed it must be constructed tens of thousands of years ago before the ice age he said in the radio interview the peak of the most recent ice age occurred some years ago if this is atlantis that would be quite amazing he said atlantis is mythical underwater city referred to in ancient legends lindberg acknowledges that the object could instead be natural formation such as meteorite that penetrated the ice during the ice age or an underwater volcano however he gives the impression that scientists are baffled by it geologists for example have supposedly told him the object can not be volcano image album baltic sea of the samples has brought up from the sea bottom are granites and gneisses and sandstones volker br chert associate professor of geology also adding titillation lindberg says documentary is being made about the seafloor anomaly the location of which he has not disclosed and he saving some juicy details for the footage we not telling everything he said we will reveal some quite interesting things in the documentary the divers recently gave samples of stone from the object to volker br chert an associate professor of geology at stockholm university swedish tabloids quote br chert as saying was surprised when researched the material found great black stone that could be volcanic rock my hypothesis is that this object this structure was formed during the ice age many thousands of years ago in other words an expert appears to back up their claims that this seafloor object is unexplained and perhaps is an ancient building complex to double check life little mysteries consulted that expert turns out neither he nor any of the other experts contacted about the baltic sea object think there is anything mysterious about it it good to hear critical voices about this sea mystery br chert wrote in an email what has been generously ignored by the team is that most of the samples they have brought up from the sea bottom are granites and gneisses and sandstones these he explains are exactly what one would expect to see in glacial basin which is what the baltic sea is region carved out by glacial ice long ago along with the mundane rocks the divers also gave him single loose piece of basaltic rock type of rock that forms from hardened lava this is out of place on the seafloor but not unusual because the whole northern baltic region is so heavily influenced by glacial thawing processes both the feature and the rock samples are likely to have formed in connection with glacial and postglacial processes he wrote possibly these rocks were transported there by glaciers glaciers often have rocks embedded in them at the end of the ice age when glaciers across northern europe melted the rocks inside them dropped to the earth surface leaving rocky deposits all over the place these are sometimes called glacial erratics or balancing rocks gallery of the weirdest balancing rocks lindberg and the ocean team did not respond to request for comment on the glacial deposit theory aside from illustration recently created by graphics artist in which the baltic seafloor object is rendered as beautiful archaeological site there has only ever been one actual image of the baltic sea object the original sonar scan image captured by the divers last summer in which the object resembles crashed ufo spaceship but experts told us that sonar image should be disregarded the sonar image has numerous artifacts in it that make it difficult to interpret and would not place too much confidence in any interpretation until better processing is done and the details of the type of sonar and particulars are provided said seabed expert dan fornari marine geologist at the woods hole oceanographic institution in massachusetts saying the dataare lacking in resolution detail and quantification the expert analysis suggests this is just glacial deposit that the ocean team discovered in sonar scan widespread media coverage fame and worldwide internet following have since ensued lindberg laments the fact that no organizations will sponsor his investigation some organizations have supposedly told him funding the dives is worth their time because the anomaly might be something very unexplainable he asks people to support his and his fellow divers work by purchasing apparel from the ocean website

nasa solves mystery outside international space station it an identified flying object on monday morning 220 or so miles about the earth nasa astronaut chris cassidy looked out the window to see mysterious object drifting by cassidy reached out to mission control about the strange item which was drifting lazily in the emptiness of space according to narrator on clip from nasa tv which shows the object passing near the progress 52 module attached to the station it lost the unidentified tag earlier this morning chris cassidy had noted an object that was floating past the station near the station progress 52 cargo ship said the nasa tv narrator that object has been identified by russian flight controllers as an antenna cover from the zvezda service module the zvezda service module was the first fully russian contribution to the international space station and served as the early cornerstone for the first human habitation of the station according to nasa it was launched atop proton rocket from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan the module provides station living quarters life support systems electrical power distribution data processing systems flight control systems and propulsion systems it also provides communications system that includes remote command capabilities from ground flight controllers its antenna must be awfully cold
uk shut down ufo desk after finding no threat files britain defence ministry shut down its ufo unit four years ago after concluding that likely did not exist and in any case did not pose threat previously secret files released friday showed the ministry of defence mod closed its hotline in 2009 despite trebling of reported sightings of unidentified flying objects ufos that year many of them near national landmarks in briefing for then defence minister bob ainsworth civil servant carl mantell said the ufo desk was using up increasing amounts of staff time but had no valuable defence output he wrote in memo that in more than 50 years no ufo sighting reported to mod has ever revealed anything to suggest an presence or military threat to the uk it added the level of resources diverted to this task is increasing in response to recent upsurge in reported sightings diverting staff from more valuable activities the national archives files reveal details of sightings recorded in the two years before the ufo desk was disbanded including those around the houses of parliament and stonehenge between 2000 to 2007 the mod received an average of 150 reports year but 520 sightings were recorded in the 11 months to november 2009 according to briefing in the files officials said one possible reason for the surge could have been the trend for releasing chinese lanterns which appear like floating lights in the sky many sightings were made in the summer months by people out walking their dogs having barbecues and in one case relaxing in hot tub

ufos over china not quite analyst says those probably were not ufos that hovered over china recently massachusetts institute of technology analyst said the images of the ufos have caused quite stir in china and on blogs around the world but many of the images appear to be faked with the software program photoshop and the ones that were not faked seem to depict the launch of chinese ballistic missile said geoffrey forden an mit weapons analyst forden who also specializes in russian and chinese space systems published his analysis on blog called arms control wonk in the analysis forden used scientific theories to examine the images of the flying object that he felt were not created with photoshop it seems to me that missile launch somewhere near jiuquan and aimed at point somewhere in the eastern gobi desert is the most likely cause of this forden wrote chinese officials have been looking into the reports about ufos they have said they were trying to determine whether the objects were private or military aircraft rocket flares reflection in the sky or something else the first sighting occurred at hangzhou xiaoshan airport in the eastern part of the country according to the xinhua news agency eighteen flights were delayed or rerouted and operations shut down after twinkling lights were spotted above the terminal around july the agency said according to xinhua speculation has centered on private aircraft the china daily quoted source saying the object had military connection purported photos of the unworldly object have appeared online on youtube and on television news shows meanwhile the shanghai daily reported ufo appeared above the city of chongqing day later
nasa debunks mysterious triangular once again alien conspiracy theorists have attempted to use publicly available nasa images to prove that the space agency must be engaging in an elaborate ufo and once again they been foiled by the laws of physics this time they called attention to peculiar new footage captured by telescope onboard nasa spacecraft one of pair of probes parked on either side of the sun which together provide view of the inner solar system the footage shows venus earth and on the opposite side of the mysterious triangular object headed our way comparing it for size to the planetary objects that are seen in this telescope if my calculations are correct that thing is enormous said youtube user beepeeoildisaster in his video commentary on the footage which was captured 27 talk of quickly followed when few days later nasa scientists updated the stereo website to display newer images this is not the first time alien hunters have found what they believe to be enormous ufos in images captured by the stereo probes mysterious object spotted near mercury but this time the team of scientists who work with data from the probes decided to address the claim directly in post on the stereo website the researchers offered up an explanation of the triangular feature in the december footage the researchers say it no more than trick of the light the answer lies on the exact opposite side of the image the scientists wrote at the same time as this feature starts being visible the very bright planet venus enters the telescopic camera from the lower left the scientists note that venus and the triangle opposite each other across the middle of the camera plane stay in step as they move this is not coincidence the geometrical is actually an internal reflection of the planet venus within the telescope optics this effect has been seen many times before in this optical effect incoming light reflects back and forth off lenses and mirrors inside the telescope the shape of artifacts produced by this scattered light usually triangles and circles of various sizes depends on the relative orientations of those lenses and mirrors another example of internal reflection this time of light from planet earth can be seen in image from may 2007 more examples of internal reflection and other optical and artifacts are displayed on the scientists image artifacts web page along with explanations of the various effects
lights up brazil skies ufo spied in the skies over sao paulo has all of brazil buzzing the amateur footage shown on brazilian tv station g1 shows blurry footage of object hovering in the clouds for minute or so before disappearing in bright flash of light followed by trail of colorful bursts but is it an alien visitation or merely the latest in storied tradition of forgeries g1 anchors explain that two passersby saw the object as they were driving in their car near the town of agudos in sao paulo state they hopped out of the car to shoot the video with their handheld camera according to the tv station the cinematographers reported the earth shaking at about the same time the object vanishes in blast of light noting that other people reported the earth moving in the same general area according to the geological survey earthquake hazards program there have been no earthquakes in the area chile was rocked by few earthquakes in recent days notably magnitude temblor on february expert philip cavaca told g1 that the film was montage but hoax nonetheless it can be seen in one frame he told the station when the truck goes by you can tell that the ufo was moved which is to the naked eye he said according to cavaca by freezing the image you can see the exact frame in which the ufo alters the station did not reveal the identity of the videographers but did say that the video was the talk of the town in sao paulo
sightings could soon explode thanks to venus planetariums observatories weather offices and perhaps even police stations should be prepared to receive bevy of inquiries during the next couple of weeks concerning strange ufo that will soon be making appearances low in the eastern sky just before sunrise the unusual lateness of sunrise may add to the confusion for skywatchers since it coincides with the sudden arrival of the bright sky apparition but there no need to be alarmed that bright light in the sky is only the planet venus which returns to visibility wednesday this sky map shows where to look to spot venus on that date venus shines bright venus bright arrival comes in the midst of likely darkness for those who are heading out to work and school in the morning gallery photos of venus this is an artifact of daylight saving time since daylight saving time was extended into the first week of november in 2008 sunrises at this time occur later than even in the dead of winter indeed for some parts of the country the sun does rise until after local time that means that countless millions are starting their days with the stars as their morning companion perhaps you driven to work under the cover of darkness or waited at bus or train station and have looked around and gotten acquainted with the starry background if you been glancing toward the part of the sky you probably have noticed anything particularly noteworthy or morning sky change looms but it will all change quite suddenly on the morning of on that morning about before sunrise dazzling object will suddenly appear just above the horizon it likely to take more than few people by surprise since it simply was there on previous mornings and on following mornings it will appear noticeably higher on the horizon this is venus beginning spectacular morning apparition it climbs nearly 10 degrees high portion of the sky that can be covered by your clenched fist held at arm length at sunrise on the final morning of daylight saving time clocks will be set back one hour the following day and sunrises will come an hour earlier but by then venus will be firmly established as dazzling harbinger of sunrise venus will be 20 degrees high at sunrise on 16 and 27 degrees on 25 as seen from northern hemisphere locations around 40 degrees north latitude as november ends venus rises full three hours before the sun and hangs almost 30 degrees high at sunrise venus will brighten impressively throughout the month for early morning commuters who will likely wonder about this brilliant luminary bursting upon the predawn scene venus will no doubt call attention to itself venus quick transition some might wonder why venus will become so quickly established as dazzling morning entity compared with those occasions when it seems to take many days or weeks sometimes even months to transition into the evening sky the difference lies in venus position relative to the earth when venus moves from the morning sky into the evening sky called superior conjunction it located on the opposite side of the sun relative to earth located at about 160 million miles from earth on these occasions venus is moving at its slowest speed against the background stars what more it is also moving in the same apparent direction against the stars as the sun to the east so in the days leading up to and then even after superior conjunction venus continues to languish in the bright glare of the sun finally and very gradually venus moves just far enough away from the sun to be glimpsed for short time low near the western horizon shortly after sunset perhaps after number of weeks the planey climbs high enough to become conspicuous to all in our evening sky but in morning transition things are much different at inferior conjunction which is where venus was on 28 the planet passed between earth and the sun it was also only about 25 million miles from earth more than six times closer than it is at superior conjunction so venus is moving much faster against the background stars and most importantly as seen from our earthly vantage point the sun and venus appear to be moving in opposite directions while the sun plods along toward the east venus is racing away to the west which allows it to literally appear to bolt into the morning sky and become readily established as predawn beacon over the span of just week or two as opposed to many weeks in the evening and lastly because venus is so much nearer morning apparitions begin with the planet already near its peak brilliance crescent venus this phase of venus looks most remarkable through telescope especially early in november observers with optical aid will be treated to the marvel of huge close to an arc minute long but crescent only few percent illuminated when venus is first sighted after inferior conjunction you can even see the crescent with 7x50 binoculars and some folks with exceptional eyesight might even be able to perceive it without optical aid so if you hear about any strange ufo sightings being made in the early morning hours during the coming weeks at least you now know what it likely is
