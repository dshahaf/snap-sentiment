there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor's effort .  often a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile .  when one of these comes along , i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie , that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders .  but sometimes there is simply no other explanation , and such is the case with " the hurricane . "  this biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin " hurricane " carter would normally be called " norman jewison's 'the hurricane , ' " as per the tradition of referring to a film " belonging " to a director .  but though he does decent work , jewison cannot claim ownership of " the hurricane , " because there is one reason this film works at all , and his name is denzel washington .  washington plays carter , a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late-night shooting in a bar .  jailed for 20 years , he maintained that he had never committed the crimes , but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals .  the situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter .  through the efforts of that group and carter's lawyers , he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted .  the film details carter's childhood , which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop ( dan hedaya ) .  when he finally got out of prison for good , carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer , seemingly having his career on track , until the police framed him for multiple homicide .  despite the efforts of political activists and celebrities , he remained imprisoned .  flash forward to 1983 , when lesra ( vicellous reon shannon ) a young african-american boy , living with a group of canadian tutors , reads the book carter wrote while in prison .  the book , entitled " the sixteenth round , " opens young lesra's eyes to the injustice that was carter's life , and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer .  lesra convinces his canadian friends ( deborah unger , liev schreiber , john hannah ) to work with him towards his goal .   " the hurricane " leans on denzel washington .  he must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will , and he does so brilliantly .  it's probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter , because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be .  it would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter--a fictional personality invented solely for the film .  the actor's work is masterful ; washington throws himself into every moment , refusing to keep the audience at arm's length .  we feel everything he feels : the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life , the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight , and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost .  washington's is a performance of weight and emotional depth .  he doesn't merely play angry , happy , or sad ; he feels it at the deepest level .  his work is masterful , and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor .  norman jewison directs the film , doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection .   " the hurricane " moves quickly , with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely .  jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well ; the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is , and nothing is terribly confusing .  his boxing scenes , constructed with clear inspiration from " raging bull , " get inside the action very well , and they are believable as real sports footage .  jewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick : carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform , and jewison , assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington , shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude , and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell .  jewison's best achievement in " the hurricane " is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard-knock life , and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again .  sadly , though , the film's chief failures lie with the screenplay , as with most of the good-but-not-great efforts to round the pike this winter .  there is much to interest a viewer in " the hurricane , " but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich ? d route possible , it does .  take a look at the supporting characters , for example , who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil .  carter and lesra ( played nicely by shannon , who deserves credit ) are the only real people here ; everyone else is a stereotype .  the canadians are good .  the cops are bad .  the canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey-dovey commune ( and it is a commune , despite the film's failure to make that clear ) , while every racist cop ( especially dan hedaya's ) melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room .  much of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey ( " hate put me in prison .  love's gonna bust me out . " ) , and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made-for-tv lifetime special .  it's too bad .  the cast is game , the director does his job , and the subject matter is interesting , but the script takes the safer , slightly more boring route far too often .  i wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against carter other than " he's a racist pig . "  i wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice .  in short , i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens .  criticism has been levied against the liberties " the hurricane " takes with the truth of what really happened to carter , and much of it is deserved .  for example , the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello , only to be screwed by the judges , who ruled giardello the winner .  most accounts of the fight , however , have carter losing fairly .  furthermore , much of carter's criminal past is conveniently left out of the film , and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained .  of course , " the hurricane " works mainly as a fable , so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially , but even dismissing such issues don't remove one fact : " the hurricane " is a highly flawed film .  only one actor could have made a schmaltzy , predictable picture like this work as well as it does , and it's a good thing " the hurricane " has that actor .  carter has been quoted as saying , " denzel washington is making me look good , " but he's not the only one .  washington makes this film look good .  denzel washington's " the hurricane . "  sounds pretty good to me .  
with more and more television shows having gay characters , and even the infamous " ellen " sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian , the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines .  the birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy .  then along came in & out , and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released .  it's also noticeable that this " alternative lifestyle " becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort .  while it's a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety .  but the way we're using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically .  while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy .  it doesn't poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all it's comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been .  the idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids-afflicted gay man in philadelphia .  if you remember , during his acceptance speech , hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community , and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life .  it's a serious and touchy subject , but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy , and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick .  it's true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual , it may have been more controversial , but because it was written by an openly gay writer , the prerogative was set .  kevin kline , who only seems to become more and more acclaimed , stars as howard brackett , a high school english teacher in the small , picturesque town of greenleaf , indiana .  after a three-year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery ( joan cusack ) , a wedding date has been set , and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story - greenleaf high graduate cameron drake ( matt dillon ) is up for a best actor oscar .  the small town eagerly awaits both events , and both seem quite astronomical , but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other .  when cameron drake is announced the winner , the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher , mr . brackett .  everyone is cheering back in greenleaf - that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words , " and he's gay . "  the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop .  the thing is , nobody , including howard , can understand how cameron came to that conclusion , and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf .  naturally the questions pour from howard's fiancee , parents ( debbie reynolds & wilford brimley ) , students , and the high school's principal , tom halliwell ( bob newhart ) , and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious : howard is clean , neat , honest , sincere , a romantic , and perhaps the most incriminating fact , he loves barbara streisand .  the frenzy isn't helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and " entertainment tonight " wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning .  one particular reporter is peter malloy ( tom selleck ) of " inside entertainment " , who unlike the collage of other reporters , wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett , including coverage of his wedding .  the intrusion is all but welcome by howard , who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute .  it seems that no matter where he turns , a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees .  the dominoes begin to tumble as howard's closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay .  it all sounds very devastating , and it would be if it weren't presented with near-perfection by one of this year's most delightful ensemble casts .  kline seems only to improve with age , and he is downright perfect here .  the great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine , and they use it wonderfully .  every single actor turns in one of their best performances ever .  dillon has never been so likeable , cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role , and brimley , reynolds , and newhart all provide huge laughs when they're up to bat .  rudnick's script is heavily laced with wit and humor , and you'll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes .  while in & out doesn't carry enough to give it four stars , it remains one of the best done films of the year , all-around .  the script is exuberant , the actors are absolutely top- notch , and we're allowed just the perfect blend of heart-tugging so as not to bog down the laughs .  it remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety , yet we're still allowed a sappily touching ending .  despite it's subject matter , and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex , this is a movie that everyone could , and should , enjoy .  frank oz , best known as a voice talent for muppets , directs this film quite delightfully , using all the potential rudnick's script has to offer , which turns out to be quite a bit .  check this one out .  you'll have a gay old time .  
star wars : episode i - the phantom menace review  a review by jamey hughton stars )  starring-liam neeson , ewan mcgregor , natalie portman and jake lloyd director-george lucas rated g  with all the hype that star wars : episode 1- the phantom menace has been receiving , it seems almost impossible to avoid interest in seeing the film .  the movie is easily the most anticipated motion picture ever , with a marketing campaign so strong it has brought colonel sanders , the taco bell chihuahua and pizza hut together .  can george lucas succeed yet again with transporting us back a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away . . . . ?  yes . this star wars prequel may be the worst of the bunch , with amateurish dialogue and an overall lack of humanity .  but that doesn't mean it fails to comply on the basis of solid entertainment .  the phantom menace features the most eye-catching , jaw-dropping visual look in cinematic history .  the tremendous action sequences will have you clinging to your arm rest , and the special effects are nothing short of the best ( and most plentiful ) to ever be caught on film .  the vast digitized worlds and sheer imagination that was applied to this project is astounding .  the phantom menace is a delectable feast for the senses , even if it has some disappointing aspects .  after we're treated to the famous prologue in the sky , with john williams' thundering score , we meet qui-gon jonn ( liam neeson ) and young obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , a jedi master and his trainee `padawan' .  they are on the ship accommodating the fleet headquarters for the evil trade federation , and have been sent to settle disputes regarding the taxation of trade routes to the planet of naboo .  oh , but enough about that .  the prime concern for this prequel is introducing young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) into the picture .  as you already know , this seemingly charming lad is the boy who will soon become darth vader .  a spectacular pod race comes soon hereafter .  this particular race is the most exciting , energetic , high-octane action sequence that you'll ever see .  one of the delights of the series is meeting the newest set of strange alien creatures that lucas has devised , and the phantom menace is no exception .  i loved sebulba , the rat-like scoundrel whom anakin has to face in the pod race , and boss nass , the leader of the gungans ( who are a neighbouring species to naboo ) .  one character who has been subject to criticism is jar-jar binks , a member of the gungan race .  jar-jar speaks like roger rabbit on a hallucinogenic drug , and is there for the sole purpose of supplying comic relief .  yes , he is initially annoying , but i can admit to laughing over some of his harmless , goofy antics .  there is some lack of dramatic pull in this star wars entry , but the presentation almost makes you forget the plot and character lapses .  the final light-saber battle , between the jedi's and the horrific ( and terminally underused ) villain darth maul , is spectacular to behold .  jabba the hutt , yoda , c-3po and r2-d2 have cameo appearances .  lucas has not forget how to captivate an audience , even if his latest shows obvious signs of tiredness .  one can only wonder what the possible technology will present for the next two installments , episode's i and ii .  when they arrive , you'll know where to find me .  
airplane ! is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film-making .  after all , it's brought to us by one of the best known satire writing/directing teams .  even if most people don't recognize the names behind the films , they are bound to recognize the titles : airplane ! , top secret , the naked gun , and hot shots to name a few .  but although the zucker/abrahams/zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977 , airplane !  remains the true cornerstone of their work , and their directorial debuts .  in the seventies , disaster films seemed to be at an all time high .  films like earthquake , the towering inferno , and the poseidon adventure were big hits .  there was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane - a series that spanned the entire decade .  and so , in 1980 , we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film .  this time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean .   .   .  it had to do with bad fish .  airplane ! is the story of ted striker ( robert hays ) - an ex-fighter-pilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six , er , seven comrades .  unable to stop living in the past , ted's world fell apart .  he spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job , and eventually , as we begin this film , is getting dumped by his lover , flight attendant elaine dickinson ( julie hagerty ) .  in a desperate attempt not to lose her , ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working .  unfortunately , she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her , which leaves him wallowing in self-pity .  in the midst of it all , something happens .  someone gets sick .  then another .  then another .  soon , the whole plane is full of deathly-ill chicago-bound people .   .   .  and when the pilots get sick ( played by peter graves , kareem abdul-jabbar , and frank ashmore ) , who will save the day ?   ( gee , i wonder )  of course the main draw here is the non-stop " whiz-bang " comedy , with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags .  although i had seen this movie a few times before , i was still laughing thru the entire thing .  the most fun character by far is the doctor , played by leslie nielsen .  he's a dry , subtle , sterotypically straight-faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film .  in a film like this , you're not really expecting an elaborate production , so one can't complain about the amateurish quality .  what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny , played by stephen stucker .  this character is pointless , nauseating , and very unfunny .  i don't know why he was put in there , and i don't think anybody will find a good excuse .  and when the film nears an end , it slows down quite a bit , almost getting old .  you gotta give it to a movie that only runs 88 minutes and can feel two hours long .  aside from that , airplane !  is really a top-notch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic .  it would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friends , especially if they haven't seen it .  and if they ask what the plot is , just tell 'em " it's a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film , but that's not important right now . "  if you've seen the film , you'll understand ; - )  
i don't know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people , but it's something i used to wonder about when i was younger .  i can't decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat , but i'm pretty sure andrew niccol , screenwriter for the truman show , has had the same curious thought .  the truman show is about a man ( jim carrey ) whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public .  since birth , he's been living in the fictional island town of seahaven , fla . , which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign .  all the people in truman burbank's life are actors , and the anonymous townfolk paid extras .  people watch truman's life 24 hours a day , live , with no commercial interruptions .  revenue comes instead from product placement , a staple of contemporary hollywood , with truman's friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones .  the sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else .  even if you haven't seen the truman show , you've probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials , the trailer and other promotion blitzes .  if anything i've written so far is a surprise to you , then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news .  either way , you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it , because otherwise you'll probably think it sucks .  it begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror , reciting the crucial " eat me " scene from alive , wishing his neighbors a good day , afternoon and evening , and living in domestic bliss with his wife ( laura linney ) .  but weird things start happening .  a stage light comes falling out of the sky , truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father .  we learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child , sailing through a rainstorm .  the death was staged by director christof ( ed harris ) , who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island .  similar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth , not the least of them truman's best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) , who assures him he's not in on any conspiracy because the last thing he'd ever do is hurt him .  as truman's trusting eyes tear over , christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else .  there's even a daily behind-the-scenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of truman's existence .  the key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor and drama , because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions .  and it all hinges on carrey , who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on .  he's come a long way from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura .  most fundamentally , it's just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a person's life without the person realizing it -- how they coordinate extras , hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors .  the most interesting thing about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this .  sure , the most interesting tv genre of the '90s has been reality programming and jerry springer's popularity is through the roof , but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves .  and when news shows use hidden cameras , it's done in the name of the greater good , not entertainment .  but merge the two and you've got the truman show .  right now , it's implausible -- i mean , the fcc won't let you say the s-word on the air ; do you think they'd let you broadcast every detail of a man's life to the entire world without his consent ?  one day , though , it could happen .  and , even though it would mean the end of privacy , people would eat it up .  you know they would .  
in the opening shot of midnight cowboy , we see a close-up of a blank movie screen at a drive-in .  we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses' hooves .  without an image projected onto the screen , the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind's eye .  even without having seen a cowboys and indians movie , somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema .  but do cowboys really exist , or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper ?  exploring this theme , director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream , an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept .  is the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend ?  midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream , like image of the cowboy , is merely a myth .  as joe buck migrates from place to place , he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself , only further degeneration .  during the opening credits , joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads `john wayne : the alamo . '  as joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show , a lady on the air describes her ideal man as `gary cooper ? but he's dead . '  a troubled expression comes across joe's face , as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone .  having adopted the image of a cowboy since youth , joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody .  joe's persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream .  he romanticizes about making it in the big city , but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance .  by the end of midnight cowboy , joe buck loses everything and gains nothing .  just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen , we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success .  but how realistic are these ideals ?  joe had raped and been raped in texas .  the scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york , but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas .  alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation .  the ability to pack up one's belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention .  schlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe's abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny .  we understand that joe adopts the fa ? ade of a cowboy , a symbol of virility and gallantry , as an attempt to neutralize his shame .  he runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york .  in the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe's encounter with the gay student , joe buck spills ketchup on himself .  standing up , we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh .  schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe's virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals , signifying emasculation .  beyond the symbol of castration , the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgin's first sexual encounter , a reference to joe's first homosexual liaison .  the fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe's emasculation .  it is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients , but effortlessly attracts men .  joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity ; new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and `faggot stuff . '  there are two predominant images of new york .  the first is that new york is the rich , cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty .  the other new york is travis bickle's new york , a seedy , corruptive hell on earth .  joe envisions new york as the former , but is presented with the latter .  mirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine , he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men .  joe thinks he is performing a great service for new york , but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions .  the people steal joe's money , the landlord confiscates his luggage , and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity .  what has become of joe's american dream ?  schlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party .  joe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food , drugs , and sex .  at the party , all of joe and ratzo's desires are made flesh ; joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami .  contrasting joe's daily struggles , shots of warhol's crew display wanton indulgence .  there is an irreverence in the partygoers' attitude ; we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular , orgies breaking out in the periphery , and drugs passed around like party favors .  the party makes a mockery of joe' s ideals .  joe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america ; scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joe's toils .  the american dream , schlesinger suggests , is merely a proletarian fantasy , for those who are content no longer dream , but become indolent .  as joe heads to miami , all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him .  his masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished .  for joe , nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately , he surrenders the identity .  tossing his boots into the garbage , he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami .  the final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus , more introspective , taking only a few glances outside the window .  instead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york , schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe .  reflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus' window with joe hardly taking notice .  the scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before .  the world seems smaller to joe now ; the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream .  no longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo ; he resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means .  midnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream .  there is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few indians , you can set up a ranch out west and raise a beautiful family .  then there is the jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock , with perseverance , can make a fortune in the big city .  joe's attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york .  during his search for an intangible paradise , joe ends up raping a girl and killing a man .  an allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream , joe buck's progressive moral atrophy is a warning against the pursuit of illusory icons .  
before even seeing a single frame of the film , it would be easy to snicker at deep impact , in which a comet on a collision course with earth threatens the existence of all life on the planet .  it is the latest entry in this decade's dubious revival of the '70s disaster film , and the first of two " the sky is falling " flicks to hit screens this year ( the other being this coming july's armageddon , in which a meteor is the threat ) .  its tagline , " oceans rise .  cities fall .  hope survives " is not as cornball as that of the utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight ( " they came in alone . . . the only way out . . .  is together " ) , but it's every bit as treacly .  the opening moments of deep impact offer more to snicker at .  the cheesiness is not confined to the disaster movie conventions , such as the usual opening " roll call , " in which all the major characters and their personal problems are introduced .  the most prominent of the " personal " stories is that of ambitious tv news reporter jenny lerner ( tea leoni ) , who is distraught that her father ( maximilian schell ) left her mother ( vanessa redgrave ) for a younger woman ( rya kihlstedt ) .  what is just as snicker-worthy is how this co-venture between paramount and dreamworks skg aggressively pushes another high-profile corporate collaboration , microsoft and nbc's cable news network msnbc , which employs jenny , who is the film's ostensible main character .  in the vision of america presented here , msnbc is the television news source of choice in every home , when in reality it only reaches a fraction of the country .  the initial signs point toward something along the lines of a volcano or dante's peak , but there's one thing about deep impact i underestimated : the skills of director mimi leder .  she won an emmy for her helming work on nbc's smash er , which is essentially a weekly disaster movie , each episode featuring a new set of guest stars with their own personal and medical crises .  the challenge presented by this format to the director is twofold : ( 1 ) to make the audience care for these guest characters , regardless of how briefly seen or thinly written they are , and ( 2 ) powerfully tug at the emotions without being heavy-handed or overly melodramatic .  having passed the " er challenge " in numerous episodes and showed a flair for creating suspense in the peacemaker , leder could not be a better fit to bring michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin's rather formulaic disaster screenplay to screen .  as the countdown to impact progresses , the ominous feeling of doom is palpable , leading the final act to take on a surprisingly convincing and affecting emotional dimension .  there's nothing here that will profoundly move anyone , but the fact that anything manages to touch the heart is high achievement in a genre generally more concerned with effects .  situations that initially feel contrived , such as jenny's familial crisis and the teenage romance between sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) and comet discoverer leo biederman ( elijah wood ) , achieve some poignance ; and even the more vaguely drawn characters , including u . s . president tom beck ( morgan freeman ) , astronaut spurgeon " fish " tanner ( robert duvall ) , and his rather faceless crew ( ron eldard , jon favreau , mary mccormack , blair underwood , and alexander baluyev ) aboard the comet-bombing spacecraft messiah , have their share of touching moments .  the latter fact owes a debt to the actors , who all do a solid job and are well-cast , with the possible exception of leoni ; she delivers a decent performance , but her trademark unconventional speech rhythms and line delivery make her somewhat hard to buy as a star news broadcaster .  although its catastrophic theme and impressive special effects work ( the giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular ) place deep impact in the same category as the likes of twister , it is the first of the '90s disaster films to successfully marry the advanced film technology with emotions that ring true--a film that makes a genuine impact , even if it isn't as deep as hoped .  
upon arriving at the theater during the opening credits , i took my seat and prepared myself for what appeared to be " hellraiser meets the crow " .  but as soon as kiefer sutherland began speaking the narrative monologue , describing " the strangers " and their reasons for contacting human beings , i was hooked .  there was something especially compelling about the nature of his voice .  i knew from the start that i was going to witness the actions of his character rather than the actor attempting the character .  sutherland played the role as a true veteran .  upon the completion of his monologue , the camera arrives on sutherland in such a fashion that you can only wonder how long alex proyas spent on cinematography .  i would imagine , for a film of this caliber , that maximum hours of work were spent where they were needed the most .  the film flowed beautifully .  as i was being taken through the intricate regions of the " dark city " , a clever plot began to unravel , to the point where the last time i had seen such clever plot twists were in " the usual suspects " .  not to mention a series of special effects that would make james cameron literally turn green with envy .  but if you're not exactly the biggest sci-fi fan , caveat emptor .  get ready for the atmostpheric darkness of " 12 monkeys " or " the crow " without the boredom or depression .  the concept of the plot is as mindstretching as " 12 monkeys " was , however , so be prepared and be sophisticated .  and imagine a picture that finally does justice to the comic-book-gone-feature-film fad that hollywood has recently become abusive of .  dark city simply puts " spawn " to shame .  in fact , during the climax of the film i couldn't help but feel the strong presence of an " akira " -esque explosion throughout the general feeling of the movie .  so my initial predictions were wrong .  this film is anything but the meloncholy of " hellraiser " parts one through five .  i'm never one to base a film entirly on special effects , so know that when i give dark city  it's actually because the film contained all of the neccessary ingredients to keep me entertained and awake from storyline to plot twists to camerawork to even ( tsk , tsk ) special effects .  not since contact have i recieved such deep insight into the way the human mind operates and never this year have i been so blown away .  the best film i've seen all year , and easily one of the best i've ever seen  
you've got to love disney .  no matter what they serve up , it is a guaranteed success as long as it's animated .  kids have to go see the movie .  then they have to get the toys .  oh , the video came out ?  got to buy it , or risk little billy's temper tantrums for the next month .  all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca : a visit to the magic kingdom .  stay at the disneyland hotel !  buy a disney t-shirt !  eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick !  it's both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it .  dale carnegie should have had it so good .  what's most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality .  you see , disney animated features these days have two components : theme and plot .  the theme changes with each new movie ; the plot does not .  the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped , and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features , they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same .  however , while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box-office receipts , merchandising dollars , and glimmers in the eyes of little children , critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer .  luckily , disney's latest animated offering , mulan , manages to be engaging and refreshing , even while rife with formula .  the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns , led by the imposing shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) .  soon , china's emperor ( pat morita ) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china's defense .  when the fa family is served notice , it is the elderly father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) who must answer the call , as there are no other males in the household .  fearing her father will surely be killed in battle , fa mulan ( ming-na wen ) disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army .  mulan , based on a chinese epic poem , is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling .  mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family , as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman's role , and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband , we see that " grace " is not one of her strong points .  very early on , we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one's family , and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker , mulan fails at that task .  by leaving home to fight in her father's place , she may not only spare his life , but bring honor , too .  as is the case with most disney musicals , the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film .  i'm not sure if they will get much airplay , but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time .  both lea salonga , who provides the singing voice for mulan , and donny osmond who sings for shang , the captain of mulan's army unit and obligatory love interest , are more than competent , although salonga's voice translates much better to animation .  you have to hear it to understand .  interestingly , the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan .  there is no significantly big number , which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film , but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie .  it is , however , an expectation which has been built by disney's own formulaic history , and some viewers may feel as if something is missing .  artistically , the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork , and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works , it helps to contribute a more authentic , and therefore more credible , nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically " disneyfied " ethnic tale .  there are also a couple of visually standout scenes , one involving the charge of shan-yu's hun army , which utilizes the same computer-enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast .  the other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it .  when mulan resolves to take her father's place , she dons her father's old battle armor , and unsheathes a sword .  as she does so , you can see her reflection in the polished metal .  it just left me thinking , " that was really cool . "  a wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film , varying from the straight , such as soon-tek oh as fa zhou , to the comical , such as harvey fierstein as yao , a gruff , pugilistic member of shang's conscripted army .  even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu , the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan .  although an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin , murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance .  i found the choice of b . d .  wong as shang a little strange ( you may remember him as martin short's wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride ) , but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast , so i guess anything's possible .  in any event , wong performs admirably as well .  one character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa .  she deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie , but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people .  june foray , who supplies grandmother fa's speaking voice , is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale ( as in boris and natasha ) .  marni nixon , who provides grandmother fa's singing voice , is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i , maria in west side story , and eliza in my fair lady .  with this in mind , hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history .  mulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films .  in an effort to be culturally sensitive ( and to avoid a " miss saigon " -type debacle ) , disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian-american actors for both lead and supporting roles .  in addition to the actors already mentioned , the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong , gedde watanabe , james shigeta , and george takei .  i guess clyde kusatsu wasn't available .  at a running time of slightly under an hour and a half , mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and , happily , adults .  this is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next , rather than hope that the next one is better .  
not too many people know who james whale is , but it's a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movies .  if we are to believe the semi- biographical gods and monsters , whale would have wanted it to be that way .  this is an insightful , haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director , and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie .  gods and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of whale's life because it tracks only the final few days of his life , and it's probably a better movie for it .  it's focus is on whale's ( ian mckellen ) untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) .  it begins with whale ( a fairly talented artist , aside from being a director ) asking boone to " sit for him , " ( pose for a portrait ) .  at first , boone doesn't realize that whale is gay and grows fascinated with the old man .  when he does discover whale's sexual orientation from his dedicated and protective maid ( lynn redgrave ) , he is frightened , refusing to sit for the guy .  but he comes back , only to storm out again , disgusted with whale's " locker room talk . "  boone returns yet another time , after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned " locker room talk , " and finds their platonic relationship to be strengthening .  meanwhile , jimmy himself is suffering from hallucinations and mental attacks as a result of his stroke not long ago .  his ailment leads to desperation and depression , which build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor .  what is perhaps most sensational about gods and monsters is brendan fraser's bravura performance ; up until seeing this film i intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he is in ( blast from the past , for example ) .  i was surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself to be here .  this is impressive because his character's dialogue is minimal , with mckellan doing most of the talking .  that requires fraser to act through body language ; a difficult skill to master , but something he proves capable of doing well .  this is not to ignore mckellan's oscar nominated turn .  he earned that nomination with his touching performance here ( although , at the risk of sounding like a philistine , i would have chosen his performance as the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination ) ; an understated , compelling gem .  whale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the hollywood horror genre , and he thought hollywood to be the equivalent of a battlefield .  he rejoiced in being free from it , only reluctantly going to receptions with fellow movie people .  in the end , perhaps , it is what killed him : the memories of hollywood and war blending together to form a living nightmare .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;  
 " . . it's certainly more than just a monster story . . "  - kenneth branagh , director/actor/co-writer of mary shelley's frankenstein .  kenneth branagh's new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein-films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world , including the most controversial version of them all - directed by james whale .  the dark and stormy nights , the lightning bolts , the charnel houses of spare body parts , the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful .  but the center of the film , quieter and more thoughtful , contains the real story .  horror-fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror .  branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues : morality , philosophy and human elements of the story , and not on old fashioned horror cliches .  his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel .  the film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean .  the year is 1794 .  a bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters .  his gole is to reach the north pole at all costs .  as the ice closes around his ship , a figure appears on the horizon .  it's a man .  exhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew .  his name is victor frankenstein ( kenneth branagh ) and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown .  the myserious stranger begins his tale , or more precisely his confession , in geneva , 1773 .  he is remembering his childhood and youth .  laughter , banquets and parties - a happy life , without troubles or concerns .  here victor lived with his father ( ian holm ) , mother ( cherie lunghi ) , his surrogate sister ( helena boham carter ) and his servants in happiness and harmony .  this idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed .  like thunder from a quite sky , his mother dies , giving birth to his youngest brother .  shocked , baffled and then gradually changed by grief and despair , victor ( already interested in science ) becomes obsessed with death .  standing on his mother's grave he says : " oh mother . . you  did not have to die . . . no one should ever die . . . i  will stop this . . i  promiss . . "  after proposing marridge to his surrogate sister and promising to return as soon as his studies are finished , victor travels to ingolstadt , in presuite of a medical career .  after a while his obsession totally overtakes him as he is working day and night , creating life from death .  composing dead bodies , frankenstein wanted to create the perfect man - both physically and mentally .  with strong electrical impulses , he managed to breeth life into his creation .  the result was ugliness .  realizing what he has done , frankenstein tried to undo his work , but it was to late .  the creature has escaped .  because of the epidemic , frankenstein hoped that his creation has died and returned to his home , making plans for the wedding .  for a while everything is as it was before his mother's death .  but then one by one his loved once are dying mysteriously . . .  whale's picture , although powerful , never managed to capture the total depth of the novel .  brannagh has more or less done that .  another thing is characters and actors .  branagh has developed every character and assembled a magnificent cast .  the greatest performances comes from de niro - the monster , that has been played by ( among others ) charles ogle , karloff , lon chaney , bela lugosi , glenn strange , christopher lee , fred gwynne ( as herman munster ) , and now , robert de niro .  alone , hated and feared , he is completely aware of his ugliness .  at first he is like a helpless , abandoned child , desperately reaching out for love .  later when he reads frankenstein's journal , and learns that he is composed of dead bodies , his love turns into rage as he is seeking revenge .  he is capable of killing without regret .   " i took him by the throughout and lifted him off the ground . . . . and  then i slowly crushed his neck . . . and  as i killed him , i saw your face . . "  that is how he reveals his savage nature to his creator .  and yet , he is never quite evil in our eyes and his vaulerbility and his loneliness are palpable : " for the sympathy of one living being i would make peace with all . "  rarely has a cinematic interpretation of " the daemon " approached the level of three-dimensionality and humanity with which it is portrayed in the novel .  another vital thing is the character of victor frankenstein .  in most of the previous adaptions he was simply a mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses and then creates a monster ( god knows why ! ) with the power of an electrical storm .  almost no time was granted on his charecter , who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel .  here , branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein , establishes his obsession with the very nature of life and death , sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment , and somehow manages to build up to a rousing and horrifying creation scene .  branagh plays frankenstein with a remarkable understanding of his character .  on the outside he is strong , ambitious and talented scientist , but deep down he is unsecure , fragile and vaulerble , constantly haunted by the ghosts from his past .  helen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankenstein's surrogate sister , who at the end becomes his wife for a little while , before death drives them apart .  the rest of the cast , playing secondary characters , is solid and nothing less than convincing .  visually the film is stunning ( especially the makeup ) .  the spinning camera , the constantly building-up musical acore , the art direction , the production design , the costumes are all magnificent : from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps and dark forests , to the plague-riddled streets of ingolstadt , mary shelley's frankenstein is a wonder to behold .  kenneth branagh directs his film as if the script was written by shakespeare : " . . all  i once loved lies in a shallow grave . . . . by  my hand . . " .  and the film ends exacly as hamlet , when the creature sets both his and his creator's body on fire .  the film ends with frankenstein and his creation burning in the almost hellish fire in the darkness .  and a terrifying last close-up on the creature's smiling face .  can a man create life , then abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him ?  to whom are its actions then attributable : the creature or the being who brought about its existence ?  shelley did not answer these questions , but she certainly posed them .  following her example , branagh does the same .  his film is a tragic saga about playing god .  victor frankenstein is not an evil man .  he wanted to change the world to the better .  in this he represents everything science stands for : acting without doubts , never considering the consequences of his actions .  produced by francis ford coppola , frankenstein resembles in some respects coppolas previous film " dracula " .  in comparison , i can say that " dracula " has visuals that even " frankenstein " can not live up to .  but when it comes to story , characters and casting , " frankenstein " is stronger .  but stronger than both of them , on every aspect , is neil jordan's " interview with the vampire " .  although the film is not perfect ( the camera that simply refuses to stay still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective ) , these minor faults are easily forgivable , as the picture is otherwise captivating and stimulating .  branagh has probably created one of the best ( if not the best ) adaptions of shelly's classic novel .  
john carpenter directed this stylish and gory vampire flick to which has it's good side and it's bad .  it's held up by some good performances and dazzling special effects leading up to an ending that's pretty satisfying .  james woods gives an outstanding performance that almost covers up the movie .  the good side : some neat scenes of vampires and violence .  the bad : no scares .  yes that's right , even though being directed by one of horror's most cherished directors , 'vampires' is the least bit scary , if not at all .  james woods stars as jack a vampire hunter out to stop the plans of the 'master' vampire valek played by thomas ian griffith whom wants vampires to walk in the daylight .  daniel baldwin plays his sidekick montoya , a wise-cracking guy who really isn't that funny .  in the opening scene jack along with montoya and the team of vampire hunters , find an abandoned house to which vampire occupy .  of course we all know sunshine kills vampires , and that is just how they kill these vampires : hooking them to ropes and dragging them outside letting them burn to death .  after throwing a party for what happened , the vampires that did not die come back to trash it .  they kill almost all of jack's team , leaving only a few alive .  sheryl lee plays a prostitute katrina who was bitten by valek , but not yet turned into a vampire .  she is rescued by jack and ? flees with them on their search for valek .  they have to fight they're way against vampires , leading up to a finale that is well-done with great special effects .  'vampires' definately could have been done better .  the make-up , special effects and story are first rate , but there is no scares or terror that the film could have had .  it to me had more humor than horror , almost being compared to 'fright night' with the mix of violence and comedy .  john carpenter does a great job of directing this film .  he eases through some tough times and saves the flaws , which are noticeable but forgettable .  the script is clever and funny , with many lines that make us laugh out loud .  i much enjoyed 'vampires' with a few exceptions .  it's one of those films you see but don't take to heart .  you enjoy the time you spent and go on .  the recently released 'psycho' is the same way , it's not as good as you'd hope but it is fun and entertaining .  'vampires' is a good horror flick with no scares but plenty of other content to please the viewer .  
after bloody clashes and independence won , lumumba refused to pander to the belgians , who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo .  their officers , particularly general janssens ( rudi delhem ) in the force publique , the congo's army , caused rebellions , undermining lumumba , who was outraged at the rape and murder of belgian nationals .  with unrest building , moise tshombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and the province of katanga , which contained 70 percent of the country's resources , proclaimed secession .  lumumba replaced janssens , making mobutu a colonel , and went on a pacification  tour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) , but it was too late .  'when you want to drown a dog , you say it has rabies , ' prophesies lumumba of his own fate .  peck and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players , although they frequently succumb to cliche , particularly regarding lumumba's private life .  peck's script illuminates bantu sayings like 'the hand that gives , rules' when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador .  peck's direction is less assured , with many scenes unfortunately playing like standard television fare .  he's served well , though , by his casting of ebouaney in the title role .  ebouaney is dynamic , radiating his character's fierce passion for his people and his country .  lumumba's intelligence and ability to strategize , even as he's cornered by insurmountable odds , are given life by ebouaney .  peck's subject and lead actor elevate his film above its mediocre production .   " lumumba " is a story that deserves to be told and ebouaney's performance makes the tragedy personally felt .  
contact is a film that tries to do several different things .  it is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like , to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life , to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation , and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr . ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) .  the film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals .  the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than , say , the cold-blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv's the x-files .  the aliens in contact seem to be like us-they are more curious than anything else .  they know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person .  the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly , and between the characters' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world , that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick's 2001 : a space odyssey .  most of the film , however , takes place on earth , where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens .  scientists are enthusiastic , ultraconservative religious leaders are wary , and government officials are caught somewhere in between .  the debate is fueled largely by dr . arroway's atheism ; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints , but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind's representative to another species .  the film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions , especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches - science and faith - could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed .  still , the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society .  the two " sides " are represented primarily by arroway and by far-right fundamentalists , but in reality probably 80% of americans are neither atheists nor far-right fundamentalists .  palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground , but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less-than-ideal spokesman for any ideology .  then again , the film does concentrate mostly on public debate , which does , after all , tend to be dominated by extremists , rather than on dinner-table or college-dormitory discussions .  contact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues , then , but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself .  the film's one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss .  for one thing , it resorts to the tired movie clich * that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together , as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction .  the romance rarely , if ever , sheds any light on the characters , although it occasionally tries and fails - joss's explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement ( " i guess you could say i'm a man of the cloth , but without the cloth " ) , for example , is more like a punchline to a joke than character development .  instead , the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments .  granted , this is a plot- and idea-driven film and the characters are secondary , but this just seemed like laziness on the writers' part more than anything else .  the successes of contact , however , far outweigh its failures .  even if the social commentary had fizzled altogether ( which it didn't ) , the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film .  contact doesn't quite cover all the bases , but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two-hour film , and its rejection of big-budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable .  and i would not be surprised if , ten years from now , contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction .  
the event of events is upon us .  people have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it .  i don't think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused .  it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history .  anyone who tells you " it's just a movie " is either lying or clueless .  it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic .  the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated .  but that does not mean that the film itself is bad .  in fact , it is terrific .  i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash .  it is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place .  the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation , angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo .  the republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as " the force " ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate .  unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur , the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene .  on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine , where they meet the movie's real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) .  he is an innocent slave boy , but " the force is strong with him " so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi .  as any self-respecting star wars fan should know , anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker .  >from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor's movie .  around 70% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another , and though the effects are seamless , the movie lacks soul .  i think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade , cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this .  this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far , with plenty of broad comic relief to go around , much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks .  he's essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like " exqueeze me ? "  and " mesa go now , okeday ? " , and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying .  the visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph .  if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement .  the climactic lightsaber battle ( oh , come on , as if you didn't already know ) , among other things , is outrageously entertaining and defines the term " popcorn movie " .  what made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams .  even though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days , his work here is nothing short of brilliant .  his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling .  the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia .  when you see " a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away " , when the familiar music plays , when the words " star wars " appear on screen , you'll feel a tingle even if you didn't see the movie when it first came out in '77 .  it feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin , a boy whose innocence , we know , will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side .  it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts ; we know that it will do more harm than good , but they do not .  we not only feel more involved in the story , but we feel like we're seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years .  the phantom menace , although lacking in human aspects of the story , is a very worthy installment in the star wars .  it works as an action flick , visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting ; it also works as an elicitor of memories , a piece of exquisite nostalgia .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;  
eyes wide shut isn't the masterpiece many were hoping to see in stanley kubrick's final film , but it is an impressive achievement ; a mesmerizing , haunting , adult psychodrama about marriage , fidelity and sex .  it's a stanley kubrick film from beginning to end , consistently exhibiting the auteur's trademark penchant for long , continuous takes , his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast ( indeed , eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot : kubrick , a renowned perfectionist , reportedly held his cast " hostage " on the set for nearly a year ) .  in an uncharacteristic maneuver , kubrick cast two big-name stars in the lead roles , namely real-life husband and wife tom cruise and nicole kidman .  they play bill and alice harford , a volatile couple who , during the course of a couple nights , ponder the validity of the idea that a husband and a wife must be faithful to each other .  he is an m . d . , she's unemployed and we are introduced to them as they are getting ready to go to a fancy party .  at the affair , they are both propositioned and both nearly succumb to the temptation to play around with someone else .  when they return to their lavish new york apartment kidman ( after smoking a dash of weed ) inquires whether her husband had sex with two models who approached him during the night .  he ( truthfully ) says that he did not and asks what happened with that hungarian guy she was dancing with .  they proceed to argue until alice tells her spouse a lustful story : evidently some time ago , she had a thing for a young naval officer .  she admits that she was ready to give up her whole future with bill and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even for one night .  bill is jolted by alice's story and we anticipate his reaction , but at that moment he gets a phone call and has to go " show his face " at the house of a just-deceased patient .  this turns out to be the beginning of a long and eventful night on the town .  the daughter of the dead patient hits on him but he wisely turns her down .  he almost does the dirty deed with a kindly hooker who approaches him on the street .  then , through a series of coincidences , he winds up at a gothic mansion where a ritualistic ( and frankly , creepy ) orgy takes place , with costumed people performing various public sex acts on each other .  erotic dread mounts as cruise ( who's not supposed to be there ) wonders the spacious halls watching the " action " until he is discovered to be an outsider .  much hoopla has been raised over the fact that warner bros . digitally edited the orgy scene .  with the help of a computer , they put in cloaked figures to block some of the actual sex acts ( they can still be seen , just not in all their glory ) in order to avoid the dreaded nc-17 rating .  european viewers will see the film as kubrick envisioned it .  roger ebert calls the american version the " austin powers version , " and many others have bashed the alterations .  i am of the potentially controversial opinion that the figures only supplement the scene's mystical atmosphere .  the first thing one notices about eyes wide shut is how it looks .  this is an artful , distinctively gorgeous production , shot in dark , moody hues and featuring some elaborate , beautiful scenery .  from the giant mansion used in the film's centerpiece to the decor at the christmas party to the harford's apartment , this film is always a pleasure to look at .  to boot , a great soundtrack makes it more atmospheric still .  at the core , behind the graphic , controversial content and unappealing mood , this is a good-natured movie that emphasizes the importance of fidelity .  it looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rather than erotic .  it's something superficial and yet something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship .  at the end , it seems , bill's eyes are wide open to the special kind of love he and his wife have for each other , more meaningful than anything he could ever hope to find on the streets of new york .  kubrick elicits wonderful performances from both cruise and kidman .  tom is completely convincing as dr . harford , a man who seems guided solely by destiny , with no control of the course his life will take .  nicole projects a quiet intensity as the jittery yet aggressive wife and her performance is stunningly effective : she's headed for an oscar nod .  the movie has some help from a similarly strong supporting cast , at the head of which is director-cum-thespian sidney pollock , enigmatic and articulate as harford's mysterious friend .  eyes wide shut is not perfect : the last hour could have used a slightly more scissor-happy editor and both cruise and kidman are too good- looking for me to believe that either would have a very strong temptation to philander .  still , this is an important work from a great director , and while it may not be on par with some of stanley kubrick's best it is a worthy final film , a complex exploration of jealousy and faithfulness .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;  
damn those trailers .  had it not been for the advertising of this film , which reveals far too much about its contents , i would have been glued to `under the sand' .  as it is , the film retains some value , thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling , and a more mature francois ozon in the director's chair .  marie ( charlotte rampling ) and her husband jean ( bruno cremer ) lounge on the beach .  she takes a nap while he goes for a swim .  when marie wakes up , jean is nowhere to be found .  she contacts authorities , but they can't find him either .  did he disappear to start a new life ?  was he killed by accident ?  did he commit suicide ?  marie still asks herself these questions a year later , and in order to move on with her life , she must find some answers .  it's a fine premise , and this little movie uses it to the limit .  the film moves at a leisurely pace , a bit slow , but relaxing .  it's a very visual story , and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles .  this is mostly thanks to the excellent camera work by antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie , who shot the film in a dreamy haze , and the lead performance by rampling .  rampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie , you connect with her character instantly , despite that she's delusional .  the scenes where she interacts with her husband , who she still believes is alive , are heartbreaking .  she can't quite get over him .  they've been married for twenty-five years .  the other actors , particularly jacques nolot , are excellent too .  the sex in the film is rather unneeded , but compared to ozon's `criminal lovers' , it's the disney channel .  likely to cause some discussion afterwards , `under the sand' is a fine movie going experience .  while it's hard to recommend as entertainment , it's a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss .  ozon seems to ask what you would do , and that's certainly a hard question to answer .  
scream 2 , like its predecessor , is a genre-crossing film .  it is about 50% horror film and 50% murder mystery .  the mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time .  scream was also known for its self-referential tone .  many inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies and wes craven .  again , scream 2 follows suit with characters saying such things as " sequels suck " and " the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels . "  scream 2's story is very similar to it's predecessor's .  sidney ( neve campbell ) , having survived the killing spree in scream , is now in college .  gale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a book about the murders and that book is now being released as a feature film , called stab ( which for all practical purposes is the real-world movie scream ) .  at the premiere of stab , two students from sidney's college are stabbed to death , and a new story begins .  the press descends on sidney and her college to get the scoop on this sequel killer .  they want to know all about the links between stab , sidney , and the recent murders .  the most complex self-reference i saw ( this should be an olympic event ) was the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at a press conference .  the rest of the press was watching and videotaping weathers .  the other survivors from scream were watching and videotaping the press .  the audience was watching the whole , filmed scene .   ( whew . )  the movie is packed with layers and self-references that make it a pleasure to watch .  even better would be to watch a double feature of scream and scream 2 . that's not to say that these references necessarily make scream 2 a deep , or even a good movie .  the just add to the fun of watching it .  i recommend it for other reasons as well .  what i liked best about the horror aspect of the movie is that the monster is not supernatural .  no werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength is responsible .  it is a person in a mask and a robe , his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims .  no extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer .  the down side is that if you are frightened by horror movies , you have less grounds to say " it's just a movie . "  the whodunit aspect of the movie is not that great by itself - gale weathers and deputy dewey ( david arquette , also from the original ) track down a killer .  they are likeable , but not outstanding .  but in combination with the horror aspect , the whodunit is a perfect counterpoint .  it was exactly a year ago today that i wrote the review for scream .  the internet movie database says that scream 3 is in the works , so i wonder if i'll be doing the same thing on january 1 , 1999 .  if craven and screenwriter kevin williamson are able to keep the quality high , i'll be happy to mark my calendar .  
driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small , intimate story .  it's a quiet film , a slow film , a deliberate film .  but if you're patient with it , the movie offers innumerable rewards , such as a pair of self-assured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy .  driving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry's pulitzer-prize winning play of the same name , which first opened in new york four years ago .  the play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago , los angeles , london , vienna , norway , and the soviet union .  uhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy ; he also penned the wonderful sleeper , mystic pizza .  the film , like the play , is set in atlanta , georgia , and it revolves around two people in their twilight years : a cranky , 70-something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60-something black man who becomes her chauffeur .  the movie relies on character , rather than plot , to propel the action .  in fact , the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense ; it doesn't present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together .  rather , driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life : shopping , listening to the radio , visiting the cemetery , eating fried chicken , and so on .  the film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta's history , including the 1958 bombing of the temple ( the city's oldest jewish congregation ) and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr . martin luther king , jr .  the story begins in 1948 with daisy ( tandy ) crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway .  the insurance company cancels her insurance , and her son , boolie , decides to hire her a chauffeur .  freeman , reprising his role from the play , plays the chauffeur , hoke .  the film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger .  driving miss daisy is a movie about human nature , aging , prejudice , and a great many other things , but more than anything it's about a relationship : one that spans 25 years , 4 cars , the advent of civil rights , and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon .  daisy is strong-willed and set in her ways , and , from the outset , she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur .  initially , she treats hoke with contempt , refusing to let him drive her anywhere .  once she does get in the car , daisy is the ultimate back-seat driver .  to make matters worse , she is extremely self-conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand .  eventually , however , daisy is worn down by hoke's good-natured charm and infectious cheer ; she softens and opens up to him .  tandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well , but unfortunately this feisty , cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace .  we've seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations , from on golden pond to cocoon .  nevertheless , tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own .  freeman , as hoke , on the other hand , gives the more distinctive of the two performances .  there is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color .  hoke is uneducated and illiterate , but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man , an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior .  both freeman and tandy seem to be in their element , in full command of their natural charisma .  they flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves .  they bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movie's gentle humor .  at the same time , tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama .  in his first dramatic role , dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie , tandy's loving and patient son .  drama seems to agree with aykroyd ; taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor , especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently ( ghostbusters ii , the great outdoors , my stepmother is an alien ) .  the only other significant characters in the film are daisy's housekeeper , idella , marvelously played by esther rolle ( " good times " ) , and boolie's pretentious wife , played by patti lupone .  under the direction of bruce beresford ( crimes of the heart , tender mercies ) , driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again .  but fortunately , beresford never forgets he's shooting a movie , and accordingly , he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches , such as gorgeous shots of flowers , trees , and tomatoes .  in adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen , the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety .  uhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say .  beresford wisely exercises restraint in the film's dramatic moments .  the movie tugs at your heart , but it never goes for the jugular .  the only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees .  
in these days of overlong movies ( meet joe black , the thin red line , the mask of zorro ) it is a shame that films like waking ned devine can't be longer than a paltry 90 minutes .  this is just a cute movie , even through its mildly risque subject matter .  old friends jackie ( bannen ) and michael ( kelley ) try to find the lottery winner ( they deduce must live in their dinky town of about 60 ) so that they might kiss up to him and share the winnings .  through process of elimination , they find that it must be lovable old ned devine , who they find sitting in front of his tv , clutching the winning lottery ticket in his cold dead hand .  what results is thuroughly amusing , as jackie tries to convince his wife that not claiming it would be wrong , and that they could really benefit .  after all , old ned won't miss it .  rather than divulge the later twists and turns , i'll stop here merely pointing out that jackie and michael get into all sorts of trouble in their little sleepy irish villiage .  bannen and kelly are a perfect pair .  one slightly stout , the other as thin as a rail .  both getting on in years , they make such a cute pair of old codgers .  waking ned devine may even be seen as a " full monty " for the geriatric set , especially since kelly gets buff-o for one amusing scene .  waking ned devine is by no means perfect , but it is so sincere and touching that it looks so much better than most films .  the performances by everyone in the town are great , particularly the two leads .  there is one twist at the end which i find unnecessary , but it hardly ruins the picture .  writer/director kirk jones should be held up as an example to all those hollywood screenwriters .  scripts as creative and endearing as this should be the norm , not the exception .  perhaps it makes us appreciate this wonderful film even more .  had i held off on my year's best/worst list for another day , waking ned devine ( officially released in late november of 98 ) surely would have graced the short group of the year's finest films .  it is light , but thought provoking and sweet .  i can't think of anyone who shouldn't see ( or wouldn't enjoy ) this film .  
steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a few years back ; he spent this time writing essays and short stories for " the new yorker , " several of which wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation , pure drivel ( 1998 ) .  much of the book spares tinseltown from mockery , although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview , in a fine chapter called " in search of the wily filipino . "  now , as writer and star of bowfinger , he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a career in the cinema , perhaps finally venting the frustrations ( 'everything being made now is crap' ) that led to his brief retirement from hollywood .  martin stars as bobby bowfinger , a roger corman-wannabe on the cusp of fifty and desperate for some success as a producer , quality of the projects be damned .  his accountant ( adam alexi-malle ) proposes a movie called " chubby rain , " about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops .  bowfinger latches onto the idea immediately , and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear in the film , based on the lie that america's top box office draw , kit ramsey ( murphy ) , has agreed to star .  ramsey , of course , wants nothing to do with such low-grade material , so bowfinger , on the thinking that action stars need to run , not speak , decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously .  he sends his cast members ( who aren't in on it , either ; they are told ramsey hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his co-stars ) to ramsey's table at restaurants , asks them to follow him in parking lots , etc . , spouting script dialogue , all the while shooting the outcome from a great distance .  the paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time .  ramsey is a member of mind head , a cultish self-help organization apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities .   ( as if that's not familiar enough , mind head guru terry stricter ( terence stamp ) has been dressed and combed to resemble l . ron hubbard , founder of scientology . )  when he goes to mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere to babble " white code " in his face , they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client and rush him off to a retreat , requiring bowfinger to find a stand-in .  murphy will probably win more fans as jiff , ramsey's adorable , ignoramus double , than as kit , but it is his portrayal of the latter that took courage .  always surrounded by an entourage , suffering from a racial inferiority complex , murphy plays right into the tabloid image of himself .  furthermore , consider the enemies he'll make of popular scientologists .  pacing stricter's neutral-coloured office as if on an amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer , ramsey is asked to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly .  murphy's scenes with stamp are exactly what i imagine of a john travolta " clearing . "  not that murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick ; bowfinger is steve martin's invention .  his script is surprisingly clever as satire , given that the pseudo-religion is a sitting duck , as is the entire los angeles film industry .   ( the griffin mill-types take quite a beating , in the form of robert downey jr . as bigwig jerry renfro . )  martin's decision to tell the story from a bottom feeder's point of view is what keeps it fresh and innovative-never have we seen on screen a group of people struggle this hard to complete a motion picture .  as expected , there are laughs only to be had insiders or buffs , such as martin's crew of mexican border-jumpers , who gain unexpected appreciation for the classics from reading " cahiers du cinema , " or martin's nonsensical explanation to dave , his loyal cinematographer ( jamie kennedy ) , that every movie , in the end , has a budget of two-thousand dollars ( ! ) .  most of bowfinger is universally funny , however ; i defy any viewer to keep a straight face when christine baranski , one of our brightest comediennes , is on screen .  bowfinger's main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstantial aftermath .  we're also asked to believe that a few simple close-ups of kit ramsey would redeem " chubby rain , " z-grade entertainment that would make ed wood blush .   ( this aspect of bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in oz's last directorial effort , the poorly conceived in & out . )  these are significant enough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece .  as i mentioned at the start of this review , bowfinger offers solid reasons not to do what heather graham's character daisy does : hop a bus to hollywood in search of stardom .  that said , it offers one fantastic reason to get on that bus : the sense of community between filmmakers who gel is awesome .  martin gets sentimental by story's end as he did in l . a . story , and how could he not ?  for those who can hack it , the movies might be the greatest business in the world .  
like the great musical pieces of mozart himself , amadeus is a true work of art .  it is one of those few movies of the 80's that will be known for its class , its style , and its intelligence .  why is this such a good film ?  there are almost too many reasons to explain .  the story : court composer salieri ( f .  murray abraham ) feels waves of different emotions going through his head as wolfgang amadeus mozart ( tom hulce ) comes into his life as the young genius composer .  salieri feels envy , and jealousy , but at the same time is fascinated with mozart's brilliance and ingenious .  we travel through mozart's life as a composer , through his struggles , his triumphs , and ultimately , his demise .  the acting : abraham is magnificient as salieri ; his acting range enables him to focus on each individual emotion and express it through his speech and body language .  this performance earned him a well deserved oscar .  tom hulce is interesting as well as mozart , a quirky , annoying bratty kid with an annoying laugh .  he's strong , but weak at the same time , and must be aided by his wife ( elizabeth berridge ) , who is good in her role , but lacks dramatic depth .  jeffrey jones , in a smaller , more dignified role than such roles in stay tuned and mom and dad save the world , is cast perfectly because of his noble charm .  the movie : every element of this movie works .  the costumes and makeup are very memorable , as well as its stunning art direction , and unforgettable scores ( adapted from mozart's original music ) .  while wolfgang amadeus mozart was a genius at music , milos forman proves with his film that he is a genius of filmmaking .  this movie is a classic that will be remembered for years to come .  ad2am " i almost lost my nose . . . and  i like it .  i like breathing through it .

the first thing you notice about this movie is that it's cold .  placed in minnesota and north dakota during the winter , many of the scenes take place outside with long scenes of snow-covered ground against a background of white .  just what we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night .  as with most coen brothers films , this features outlandish characters in nefarious schemes , each of which works out in the oddest way possible .  a car salesman hires a couple of hoods to kidnap his wife so that he can collect the ransom from her father .  along the way everything that can possibly go wrong does .  in brief scenes of vicious violence , people get shot through the head , in the back , face , chest and various other areas of the anatomy .  there is also one of the most unpleasant body disposal scenes yet seen on the screen .  remarkably enough , most of the movie is played for laughs .  even more remarkably , it works .  the only likable person in the film is the very pregnant sheriff ( frances mcdormand ) who hunts down the killers while eating at every possible opportunity .  with every good film the audience gains new knowledge .  here you learn _two_ things .  everyone in minnesota speaks in an annoying whining accent that would drive you crazy .  and don't do violent illegal business with low-life amoral degenerate scum-sucking losers .  oh yeah , if you get shot in the face , using a brightly decorated napkin to stop the bleeding just makes you look goofy .  
a costume drama set in the 1500s , england , elizabeth is a lush , romantic , political masterpiece about the upset over the crossing of a protestant queen from a respected catholic one .  when the court and country are a whole after the passing of the queens , the royal family , so to speak , are upset that a protestant should be crowened , and not another catholic , plus , the new queen , elizabeth i ( cate blanchette ) , was the bastard baby of the previous queen mary's father .  the persecution over catholics and protestants isn't the only majority in elizabeth .  elizabeth i must face the decision to give up personal pleasures , and her lover ( joseph fiennes of shakespeare in love ) , in order to rule , successfully , the country , which she did for 40 more years .  both elizabeth and shakespeare in love are set in the elizabethian era , and both feature a queen elizabeth i ( judi dench plays her in love ) , or course .  yet , i found elizabeth more stimulating and involving than love , not just because elizabeth features a great deal more of elizabeth i , but because i found blanchette a more powerful , hypnotic sense for the role .  elizabeth , also featuring geoffrey rush and richard attenborough , is my pick for the best picture of 1998 award .  it's a dynamic , important , breathtaking film of loyalty , power , greed , and trust .  shakespeare would die for the book rights .  
the idea at the center of the devil's advocate , which is , thus far , one of the three or four best films of 1997 , is that no matter what decision is made , evil will triumph -- god is a trickster , satan is a humanist -- " the last humanist " .  he appears in many guises , and seduces many men and women -- in his own words , " vanity -- by far my favorite sin " .  al pacino plays this role with relish , and gets to chew some delectable lines ( " lemme givya a piece o' inside wisdom on god . . . " , " i have a million names . . . " ) , as john milton -- the devil .  the main idea -- that he can appear as anyone , in any form ( in this case , a buisness man ) , harkens mainly back to terry gilliam's the time bandits .  but the film , is something else , something original .  part of what makes it so very good , is that it never takes itself too seriously -- it dabbles with morality , vanity , death , and child abuse , but doesn't try to become any profound study of power .  this is a marvelous confection -- cocky , funny , thought provoking .  it is also entertaining .  there is no way you could possibly predict the ending -- it pulls back upon itself , drawing purely out of the mind's eye .  the final shot is more creative , more daring , more challenging , then anything in cinema since the white sock in the coen's fargo .  the central themes are fascinating ( sometimes reminiscent of james' the turn of the screw , and oates' accursed inhabitants of the house of bly ) , and the product that is built around it really wows .  its nice to know that things like this are still being made .  
the long kiss goodnight ( r ) meryl streep tried it and failed .  even pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her well-bared assets .  however , geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight , a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband , renny harlin .  davis plays samantha caine , a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years .  with the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey ( samuel l . jackson ) , she slowly remembers--and reclaims--her past as charly baltimore , tough-as-nails cia operative .  needless to say , with the reappearance of samantha/charly comes the appearance of an assortment of no-goodniks out to erase more than her memory .  shane black netted a cool $4 mil for his script ; i'm not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag , but for what it's worth , it delivers the goods .  like black's previous work , such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout , the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny , quirky dialogue .  the humor especially works well in this case , for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously .  but there's no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell : who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car . . .  while ice skating ?  jackson and davis make a good team .  jackson is funny as ever as ever ; in fact , his spirited line deliveries , especially when he first appears , are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction .  as good as he is , the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis , who shows much promise as an action heroine .  what makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she doesn't take herself too seriously .  she is obviously in on the joke , slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation .  this is not to say that she doesn't need work--sometimes she lays on the " toughness " a bit too thick and comes off too much as a caricature .  but should the public embrace the film and , in turn , the notion of a kick-ass female , davis could have found her special niche .  it seems as if davis and harlin's first collaboration , the middling pirate epic cutthroat island , was just a dress rehearsal ( albeit a very costly one ) for long kiss , in which the wife-husband team hit their action stride .  anyone simply looking for a fun , escapist entertainment that requires little-to-no thinking will find this film to be a more-than-welcome kiss .  
the last steve martin film i saw , the spanish prisoner , was a very different approach for the comic actor .  as a millionaire leading a massive conspiracy in order to rob " a process " from a clueless businessman , martin's character did it all for money .  in his most recent movie , bowfinger , martin plays yet another con man except this time he does it to succeed in the film industry .  he wants to direct a successful picture that will force people to remember his name , that will make him more popular at the parties , and , most importantly , that will cause fed ex to deliver important business packages to his front door .  playing the title role , martin is once again the good guy ; the one we cheer for to complete his low budget action movie .  this con man is very likeable for some reason , even though he is doing the same exact thing as the malicious jimmy del from the spanish prisoner .  maybe the message is that , in hollywood , to win over the trust and friendship of others , you have to be a little evil .  bowfinger is a very clever comedy with great performances from its two stars .  martin , who also wrote the screenplay , is perfect as a jerk with a conscience and eddie murphy does his best " peter sellers " in two different , but equally hilarious , roles ; one as a big time move star and the other as his nerdy , burger king employee brother .  the story follows aging and failing director/producer bobby bowfinger as he makes one last attempt to become a respected member of his field by creating a b-action movie called chubby rain .  in order to attract actors and crew members , bowfinger promises them that hot shot actor kit ramsey will star in the movie .  the only problem is that kit refuses to be in it .  but this won't stop the aggressive bowfinger .  he is so determined to complete his film that he decides to put kit in it without even telling him .  he has his actors approach kit on the streets of los angeles in character with a hidden camera filming the footage .  will bowfinger be able to make his film ?  or will kit ramsey discover what exactly is going on ?  bowfinger is a very cartoon-like movie that pokes fun at hollywood and its famous residents while simultaneously holding a very solid story line .  the only area where the film really lacks is the cameo department .  this is the kind of movie that cameos are all about , it is always funny to see actors/directors/producers making fun of themselves or co-workers especially in a playful movie such as this .  besides the very repetitive and superflous ending , bowfinger is a joy to watch .  if you take a movie like this seriously then you will never enjoy it .  if you accept the incredulous plot and the extreme caricatures of real entertainment figures , the movie is great fun .  
whenever studio executives try to combine the successful formula of two blockbuster films , the end result is always a mess of a script , acting , directing , and generally a waste of time for any audience with an average iq above 40 .  the latest movie morass from hollywood , the crew , appeared equally destined to fail , a strange combination of grumpy old men and goodfellas tossed together with the likes of richard dreyfuss and burt reynolds helming the ship .  the scary thing is that it's actually entertaining and a breath of fresh air in this otherwise stale month .  the crew works for several reasons .  the clever script is reminiscent of an old billy wilder movie , following four " past their prime " wiseguys from jersey who now live in the raj mahal apartment house in miami beach .  the wiseguys find themselves being evicted from their " golden paradise " by greedy landlords bent on raising rents for new beach bunnies and boys looking for beachfront property .  the four mobsters , bobby bartellemeo ( richard dreyfuss ) , joey " bats " pistella ( burt reynolds ) , mike " the brick " donatelli ( dan hedaya ) , and tony " mouth " donato ( seymour cassel ) decide to hatch a scheme to plant there a dead body heisted from the morgue in order to drive out the new tenants and keep their home .  this " simple plan " suddenly goes screwy , of course , and the boys become involved with a stripper named ferris ( jennifer tilly ) who wants her stepmother killed , a paranoid latin drug lord who's convinced a mysterious rival is out to get him , and a rat with its tail on fire .  the crew works as a strong comedic vehicle driven by a great ensemble cast of talented character actors and subtle leading men .  instead of concentrating on bobby's search for his daughter , the film gives equal screen time to all four wiseguys , balancing the production .  the acting talents of such screen veterans as dan hedaya , seymour cassel , and the great , great burt reynolds are brought out by each character's uniqueness and synergy within the wiseguy circle .  a strong supporting cast including jeremy piven as a philandering boyfriend/cop/partner and miguel sandoval as the paranoid drug lord provide the most laughs .  the film was produced by barry sonnenfeld and carries a hint get shorty with its energetic camera work by michael dinner , emmy award-winning director of the wonder years .  the quick script written by barry fanaro , screenwriter of kingpin , is carried by plenty of subtly dry humor and wit .  the crew is a prime example of how simple and dry-witted a comedy can get these days .  the great thing is that this comedy does not need to be punctuated by bodily fluids , phallus symbols in the head , or grandmothers giving head in a spa .  in the steady flow of " extreme " comedy these days flowing from hollywood like a broken water main , it's the elder statesmen like dreyfuss , reynolds , and hedaya that can carry a comic arc with only a few weapons of choice - a decent script and good acting .  
it's terribly unfortunate that " stir of echoes , " tautly written and directed by david koepp ( who made one of 1996's unsung treasures , " the trigger effect " ) , should be released little more than a month after " the sixth sense , " which is still going strong at the box office .  these two films are undoubtedly going to be compared ( judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night ) , and although they have eerily similar storylines , " stir of echoes " is more of a straightforward psychological horror film , while " the sixth sense " is closer to a psychological drama .  additionally , while " the sixth sense " had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business , " stir of echoes " is more conventional and predictable in its final twist .  and where " the sixth sense " was disturbing , " stir of echoes " is just plain scary .  i have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities , and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits .  adapted from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago , " stir of echoes " opens with a cute six-year-old boy named jake ( zachary david cope ) who is taking a bath .  he is speaking directly at the screen , but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there .  finally , he asks , " does it hurt to be dead ? "  apparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people , but unlike " the sixth sense , " this young child isn't the focus of the picture .  instead , tom witzy ( kevin bacon ) , a chicago lineman , is our protagonist .  jake is his son , and maggie ( kathryn erbe ) , whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant , is his hard-working wife .  one night while at a party with their closest friends , tom convinces maggie's new-age sister , lisa ( illena douglas ) , to try and hypnotize him .  it unexpectedly works , and before long , tom is seeing things he wouldn't normally see , including a deceased teenage girl ( jenny morrison ) in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months .  seeking help from lisa , she tells him that , while he was under hypnosis , she told him that after he awoke , his mind will remain clear and free , like an opened door .  she didn't expect it to work , but it did , and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees .   " stir of echoes " isn't a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination , but in the thick , atmospheric mood it conjures up , it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror-drama , and is not only effective on a technical level , but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling working-class family .  kevin bacon and , especially , kathryn erbe ( 1997's " dream with the fishes " ) , are top-notch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems .  after tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions , he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house , and instead of maggie not being understanding , she instead believes what tom says , and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through , does not try to stop his pursuit .  bacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts , and therefore , are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet .  in a masterfully-done , entrancing sequence , tom is hypnotized by lisa , but instead of watching him , we instead see what he sees , starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness .  lisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater , and so , we , as audience members , are watching a movie screen from inside a theater , which is also showing a movie screen in a theater .  telling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen , we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is " sleep . "  never before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantly-construed as this one .  truthfully , this set-piece , and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt , are worth the full price of admission alone , just to see them on the big screen .  having loads of fun with her small role as maggie's sister , lisa , illeana douglas ( 1995's " to die for , " her last great character ) is a delight , but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films .  funny and enjoyably offbeat , douglas gets to utter the best line in the film : while talking to maggie about tom's visions of the girl , she remarks , " i wouldn't be worried about him seeing another girl , although the fact that she's dead gives one pause . "  also of note are jenny morrison ( 1994's " intersection " ) , who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character , and liza weil , remarkable in 1998's " whatever , " as morrison's grieving teenage sister , debbie .  if the resolution of " stir of echoes " does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential ( and it doesn't ) , what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty .  the music score , by james newton howard , and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects , successfully compliment and foreshadow the off-kilter frame-of-mind that tom is put into , and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realistically-written characters .   " stir of echoes " isn't as good as " the sixth sense , " but why should it need to be ?  both films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet , and " stir of echoes " really is a spinetinglingly good horror film .  
i hate to burst your bubble , but after all the star power , mega bucks , screenwriters , directors , and cool trailers , men in black is not the best movie of the summer .  it's pretty good in it's own right , yes , but i would probably split the " best movie " honors among face/off , spawn , con air , and maybe event horizon .  it's main problem is that it's quickly forgettable , and i can't remember one truly good scene from it .  from con air , it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt .  in spawn , it was the " living room hell " conclusion at the end .  in event horizon , it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hell's forces .  and all of face/off was pretty dang good .  but as for men in black , the only scene i still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches .  i remember it not for it's humor but because i am hate roaches with a passion and was pretty disgusted .  and yes , i did see mimic , which is something i'll touch on in a later review .  back to men in black ( is it just me , or does that sound funny ? )  i remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the 7th grade and read magazines like wizard , etc . ( for those of you who aren't comic-geeks , wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars , what the new yorker is to high society , what boy's life is to boy scots .  okay , that one was pretty pathetic . )  few people know this , but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was , while not honest-politician-rare , very hard to find .  this was after the release of the high-grossing batman forever , and it said that tommy lee jones and chris o'donnell were being considered for the roles ( in the comic book , there were no black men in black .  kind of weird , huh ? )  all i can say is , thank god they didn't cast chris o'donnell .  i know i can't be the only person on the planet who thinks he's an annoying , preppie little snot . . .  sorry .  my apologies to o'donnell fans .  i actually had a 7th grade teacher who was a big comic collector and was set to buy some of the comics from him , anticipating rather craftily that , if the movie was a big hit , it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely .  he decided not to sell them to me , because they were " innappropriate " .  hmm . . . .  so now you're probably wondering why i've wasted about 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years .  good question .  i'll move on to the movie now .  as you probably already know , will smith and tommy lee jones ( agents k and j , respectively ) belong to a top secret agency known as divison 5 , or it's nickname mib ( men in black . )  men in black is a reference to the black suits and sunglasses the agents wear , and they're mission is to investigate reports of alien landings and keep the aliens under control while they're here on earth .  not to get too technical or spoil the plot for the 6 people in the world who haven't seen this movie , but a basically-big-roach-type-bug lands in a redneck farmer's yard , inhabits his body , and attempts to destroy the entire universe .  not bad , eh ? ( i have no idea why i just typed that .  i'm not even really paying attention anymore . )  the special effects are good yet dissapointing in men in black .  i found their main headquarters to be boring , as were the " cool weapons " they had .  the noisy cricket just plain sucked , no matter what anyone said .  and the movie definitely surprised me in tone , although it probably shoudln't have .  it's director , barry sonnenfield , is known for " black humor " , directing both addams family movies .  this movie was basically a " black comedy " , not an action/sci-fi like i expected from the trailers .  don't get me wrong on what i think of this movie .  it's not bad , i gave it * * * .  it was mostly entertaining throughout it's run , and had a very good ending , although i think i was the only person in the theater not amazed by it .  my diagnosis for this picture : a good weekend rental , but not worth a movie ticket .  of course , the movie is now long gone from theaters , but that's beside the point .  i think .  
118 minutes ; not rated ( though i suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language )  mamoru oshii is a name that probably isn't very well-known to most american audiences , but perhaps it should be .  oshii was the director of last year's best-known japanese animated film import , _ghost in the shell_ , and is known among fans of japanese animation , or anime , for making films with a deep philosophical bent .  one of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series .  in its many incarnations--graphic novels ( " manga " ) , two different runs of made-for-video episodes ( original animation videos , or oavs for short ) , and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes--patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan .  set in the very near future ( though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived ) , this atypical giant robot anime features the characters , rather than the machinery , as the primary focus .  as a whole , patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan .  as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains , giant industrial robots , known as " labors " ( an interesting play on words , considering that " robot " is derived from the czech word for labor ) , have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century .  with the rise of labors , however , has come a new menace--labor crime .  this led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions , using patrol labors to fight labor crime .  the patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division , sv2 , who , through no fault of their own , have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness .  sometimes utterly hilarious , sometimes almost deadly serious , the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers , and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life .  those who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie , although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers .  the story , as has much of patlabor before , centers around the controversial babylon project , a gigantic seawall that will , on its completion , allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay .  this project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists , most notably the house of sea organization .  however , the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist , but from someone who is already dead . . .  shinohara heavy industries , the premier labor manufacturer in japan ( if not the whole world ) , has just come out with a new operating system that increases labors' movement speed and efficiency by 30% .  this hyper operating system , hos for short , has very quickly been installed into well over 90% of the nation's labors . . . including the patrol labors of sv2 .  since that installation , dozens of labors , including a heavily-armed military model , have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason . . . and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos .   ( some wags have compared this to windows 95 . )  it's up to asuma shinohara , labor command officer with sv2 and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries , to find the source of these problems before more labors--including sv2's own--fall victim to them , and before hos drags his father's company down with it .  as was the case with _ghost in the shell_ , if you just want a no-brainer actionfest , this might not be the movie for you .  _patlabor : the movie_ is more of a psychological thriller , a technological suspense drama .  it is closer , perhaps , to a chrichton novel than to an action movie ( crichton novels that have been made _into_ action movies notwithstanding ) .  there are long , thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo , similar to sequences from _ghost in the shell_ .  this movie is fraught with symbolism--in fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism .  patlabor's near-future setting is , aside from the giant robots tromping around , very similar to our own present day .  the film uses this setting to make its central point : is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up ?  are history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new ?  this is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabor's alternate-1999 setting .  as far as the technical aspects of the film go ( referring to the subtitled version , as that's the only one i've seen ) , the film transfer is clear , almost phenomenally so .  the animation quality is incredible , though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to .  the oavs and tv series were more cheerful , better-suited to humor ; the movie , however , makes everyone look a great deal less cute , and emphasizes that this is going to be , for the most part , a deadly serious storyline .  as far as cinematography goes , there are many interesting moments in _patlabor : the movie_ .  i don't think i can recall ever seeing a fish-eye perspective used in any other animated film ( save for _ghost in the shell_ , another oshii film ) , or indeed , in many other movies at all .  the cinematography is well-suited to the storyline , emphasizing what it needs to , though a couple of scenes ( where characters' features are exaggerated in anger ) may seem slightly strange to western audiences .  the audio track of _patlabor : the movie_ is in glorious hi-fi stereo , and should be used to demonstrate home theater systems--it _is_ that good .  even without headphones , sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to _come_ from that side .  giant robot footsteps are deep and booming .  the sometimes-understated , sometimes-blaring score is crisp and clear , and always right on the mark , enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery .  as far as the subtitles go , i have to say that they're among the most easily-readable subtitles i've ever seen for _anything_ .  large enough that they don't strain the eyes , but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen .  although it does have several action sequences in it , most notably the climactic conclusion , _patlabor_ is foremost not an action movie .  although it is a superbly-realized film , it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some of the characters to carry the story , and that could detract from some people's enjoyment .  my .  
susan granger's review of " the perfect storm " ( warner bros . )   " more people die on fishing boats , per capita , than working in any other job in the u . s . .  every journey a fishing boat makes can be an all-or-nothing risk .  it is life at its most exhilarating and its most terrifying , " says director wolfgang petersen ( " das boot " ) .  and that's just what he captures in this true story of struggle and humanity aboard a swordfishing boat , the andrea gail , sailing out of gloucester , massachusetts , in late october , 1991 .  early in bill wittliff's screenplay , based on sebastian junger's best-seller , we meet the crew of six .  the veteran captain ( george clooney ) is frustrated because he can't find fish on the grand banks , yet a rival skipper ( mary elizabeth mastrantonio ) brings in huge hauls .  his right-hand man ( mark walhberg ) needs money to build a new life with his girl-friend ( diane lane ) .  there's a devoted dad ( john c . reilly ) with an estranged wife and son , a free-spirited jamaican ( allen payne ) , a lonely guy ( john hawkes ) , and a last-minute replacement with a bad attitude ( william fichtner ) .  the skipper's convinced he can change his bad luck streak in remote flemish cap , and he does .  but then trouble begins .  there's a rogue wave , a man overboard and the ice machine breaks - with 60 , 000 lb .  of fish that could spoil .  but that's minor compared with a deadly monster storm approaching which a boston meteorologist describes as " a disaster of epic proportions " that also threatens the lives of a coast guard helicopter rescue team trying to save three people stranded on a sailboat on the high seas .  it's formulaic and there are cliches , but the walls of water , created by fluid dynamics simulating real-life phenomena , are awesome .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " the perfect storm " is a terrifying , suspenseful 8 .  hang on for the white-knuckle thrill ride of the summer !  
review- peter jackson's the frighteners has received some notice for setting the record for most computer effects ever in a movie , and still coming in at the extremely cheap $30 million price tag .  but for those who were dismayed by this year's blockbusters like twister and independence day , the frighteners has much more to offer than special effects .  and for those worried wether or not peter jackson would compromise to hollywood you can rest easily .  the frighteners is as far removed from hollywood as a high-profile movie can get .  michael j . fox stars as frank bannister , a con artist who can speak to ghosts .  he uses this ability to set up a scam in a small town where his ghost buddies scare the hell out of people , then he comes and pretends to get rid of them .  this is how he has made a living ever since his wife died in a car crash 5 years ago .  frank's latest customers are a young couple , played by trini alvarado and peter dobson .  when dobson ends up dead , alvarado starts to take an interest in fox .  but dobson's spirit is still around as he refuses to beleive he's dead .  this leads to a very awkward and amusing dinner date between fox and alvarado , with dobson tagging along as a ghost .  things start getting complicated for fox when he is accused for a series of murders taking place in the town .  fox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart of the victims , but noone else can see that .  so when fox shows up to try and save each victim , naturally people suspect he is the killer .  fox sees that alvarado is next on the soul collector's hit list , and the last half hour of the movie deals with fox's attempts to save her from this evil spirit .  there are many wonderful twists and turns in the screenplay written by peter jackson and frances walsh .  the movie starts off as a black comedy , and ends up a horror-action film .  the mix between these genres are perfect .  no laughs are sacrificed in the name of horror , and vice versa .  one point of contention might be a lackluster score by danny elfman .  but that hardly seems like a flaw when you have such a diverse cast all in top form .  michael j . fox delivers one of his best performances to date as a man who hides the sorrow of his wife's death , and then is forced to confront this later on .  alvarado , looking like andie macdowell , makes a great frightened , tough , and smart heroine .  and jeffery combs , as a paranoid fbi agent , is brilliantly bizaare .  the frighteners never once feels like it is running long .  the first hour is as funny as any comedy this year , and the last half hour is as thrilling as any of the big budget blockbusters .  this movie is probably what casper would've looked like if david lynch directed it .  it's easily the best film of the year , so far .  
 " he's back , and it's about time . "  was the motto for this television series pilot ( i call it a pilot , i don't care what fox network says ) revival of the cult classic british tv show , doctor who , that spawned no series , which means there are no smart network execs out there ( not exactly news to a lot of people , i know ) .  the motto was well chosen .  the series was simple , it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies , including the evil daleks , and the master , who appears in this feature , played very badly by eric roberts .  as good as this revival was , there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who .  is it the acting ?  hell , no !  paul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys who've played the doctor ( including his predecessor and off-screen friend sylvester mccoy , who appears once more for the regeneration scene ) .  he looks right for the role , is a brilliant actor , and slips effortlessly into the role , the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would .  daphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr . grace holloway , the doctor's first companion that he kisses on screen , she is not your typical female companion who screams , and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor , she is a tough , spunky american , and ashbrook shows this well .  young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee , and i've seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end ( this film included ) , which , imho , wastes his talent .  the only problem with the acting is eric roberts .  one time he had to say to mcgann's doctor , " i always dress for the occasion . "  but he broke it up , and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric , " i always . . .  dress . . .  for the occasion . "  you need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act , and who's also british , like mcgann is as the doctor .  executive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role .  i dunno who thought of casting him , but if they're reading this : news flash : eric roberts is * not * a star !  he rides on his sister's coattails , and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him .  is this problem the kisses to the past ?  they have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them , only whovians would , and they're good .  is it the script or the movie as a whole ?  the script is a classy piece of work , featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue , and the movie as a whole is one fans will love , and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series .  so what is it ?  simple : no plot .  the master , on his last legs , sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him .  the doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey , but they accidentally land in san francisco , 1999 , december 31 , where the master , with young street hood chang lee's help , opens the eye of harmony , which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor , with the help of female surgeon , dr . grace holloway , doesn't close it by then .  virtually no plot .  i was told the movie would've featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks , but a lot of rewriting went on on the set .  that shows how smart people are , as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting , and that would've gotten a four star rating out of me .  
ladies and gentlemen , 1997's independence day is here !  it's title : starship troopers .  and surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4 .  i realize that i gave last year's sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour .  after subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn't as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review .  starship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem .  as a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film .  in fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film .  starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether .  while starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : " the 'star wars' of the 90s . "  am i being to generous to this film ?  perhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races .  in essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction .  the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to .  starship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a " kick-the-aliens'-asses " style .  id4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role .  this new " star wars " has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs . an alien species .  the alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects .  however , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy .  sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization .  more than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends .  and they should be .  i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film .  this is an " event " film , but surprisingly above average .  it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved ) .  starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange " join the army " ads .  mixing a web-based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original .  stating , " would you like to know more ? " ,  these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously .  however , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way .  after witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw .  we are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) .  rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms .  however , carmen isn't as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot .  however , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico .  unfortunately , rico isn't interested in dizzy .  this setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch .  carmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up .  and as a result , dizzy signs up .  everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry .  the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships .  in reality , i found myself watching a space version of " melrose place , " but with better special effects .  an hour into the film , the war begins .  a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with .  the first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must ) .  following the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war .  the bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else .  many dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs' attacks .  a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense .  the troopers are ordered to locate the " brain " and capture it .  i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot .  it's about special effects and gory violence .  director verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci-fi days , which gave us good films like total recall .  verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood .  starship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year's event horizon .  the r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it .  my guess is that verhoeven's target audience is the 18 to 25 male group .  the film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women .  despite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful .  while watching the film , we never second guess the character's decisions because they seem perfectly clear .  thankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with .  the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you .  casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon .  to most guys , he will come across as artificial .  fortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character .  dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character .  her dizzy is extremely likeable .  denise richards also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done .  jake busey , gary busey's son , gives a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film .  neil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast .  however , he does give a good performance .  michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm .  his performance rises above the rest .  perhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside's presence on screen .  unfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star-making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars .  director verhoeven is the main star of the film .  his direction is fast and unrelentless .  he never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride .  writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein .  the writing is usually very funny , and sometimes very corny .  the dialogue is smart but not too smart .  we aren't required to know everything , but some plot holes are left unanswered .  thankfully we are not intended to notice , and we really don't ( except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while ) .  amazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues .  in fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story .  the moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage .  i haven't laughed this loud , even in some comedies .  oh , and the special effects are first rate .  starship troopers is rated r for graphic sci-fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity .  believe me when i say this : don't take young kids to see this film .  it is extremely violent .  in fact , it is probably the most violent film out this year .  however , if you are old enough ( over 17 ) to see it , starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain .  it's been a long time since i have cheered for the heros , while also cheering for the bad guys .  and still , it is my dream to see a sci-fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind , and take over the world .  now that would be entertaining !  
making his directorial debut , actor jon favreau brings along his swingers co-star , vince vaughn , for this tale of two mugs on a career trajectory to nowheresville .  favreau , who also wrote the script , is bobby , vaughn is ricky .  by day they are construction workers .  they also are wanna-be contenders , but neither has had much success .  their last bout pitted them against each other and was a draw , leaving bobby's record at 5-5-1 .  these two l . a . not-so-wise guys also work for max ( peter falk ) , a mid-level mobster , who is patient and understanding with bobby , but who hates ricky's guts .  max has an easy job for bobby ; fly to new york and make a simple delivery to a gangster named ruiz ( a smooth and silky sean combs ) .  bobby , because of his lifelong friendship with ricky , pleads with max to give his pal another chance and let him tag along to the big apple .  against his better judgment , max agrees .  of course ricky , a motormouth who inserts both feet everytime he speaks , nearly screws up everything .  while bobby tries to stay calm and professional , ricky begins swaggering and throwing money around as if he was john gotti or tony soprano .  the constrast in styles and the chemistry between favreau and vaughn is what makes made so enjoyable to watch .  favreau with his hound-dog face and slow-burn personality could be a modern-day oliver hardy , only much wiser .  vaughn is like someone vaccinated with a phonograph needle , he just keeps yakking and yakking , unaware of the havoc he creates .  yet despite bobby's constant aggravation and agitation with his partner , a bond of affection and loyalty binds them .  the contrast between the two friends is interesting to watch .  bobby is button-downed , tightly-wound , always waiting for the next shoe -courtesy of ricky - to drop .  ricky is mostly oblivious to the problems he creates and is genuinely surprised when he comes under attack for his faux paus .  in new york , the two lackeys are like fish out of water , stumbling from one situation to another , trying to keep alive .  combs is elegant , cool and low-key menacing as the gangsta they are sent to meet .  falk is amusing in his small role , while famke janssen nearly breaks your heart as bobby's lowlife girlfriend .  more than anything , made is a movie with heart .  it is loud , obnoxious and very talkative .  but the cameraderie between bobby and ricky holds the key to its interest .  favreau does a commendable job in his directorial debut .  he is a player to be watched as he can only improve with experience .  
jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the rest of the crew of the u . s . s .  enterprise are back for their third outing in the ninth film based on the 1960's series , star trek .  gone are kirk , spock and mccoy and in their wake in the very able and very talented cast from star trek : the next generation .  as usual , a crisis is brewing and it is up to the crew of the enterprise to make the galaxy safe again .  this time out the united federation of planets and an alien race led by f . murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off a planet against the colonist's will .  it turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth and the federation and their alien buddies feel that is should be used for the good of everyone and not just a few hundred colonists .  of course picard feels that this sort of treachery is wrong , so he disobeys direct orders and vows to help protect the colonists .  insurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films .  the film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as a whole outweighs the rights of a small group .  in this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction .  it doesn't do a bad job , other than it tries to inject too much humor into the story line .  many of the jokes are your typical inside star trek-fan-only jokes , while many of the others just fall flat .  the other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense .  there are only a few hundred people on this whole planet , why do they have to be moved ?  the explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f . murray abraham's aliens who number only a couple of dozen .  so the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion , at least that's plausible .  but in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen , which makes no sense whatsoever .  the other little hiccup in logic is the inclusion of worf ( michael dorn ) , the trusty klingon .  worf was on star trek : the next generation , so they want to include him in the films .  no problem so far .  worf is now a character of star trek : deep space nine , so the writers have to find a way to have him show up .  in the last star trek movie , first contact , the included worf in a credible fashion , in this one , the writers are so lazy that the completely gloss over why he is even in the movie .  what little explanation they do give is so small that you would have missed it if you weren't hanging on every word on the screen .  my minor problems with the movie aside , star trek : insurrection does have an overwhelming number of good points as compared to its bad ones .  while many of the jokes do miss the mark , many are pretty good , even for non-trekkies .  the special effects are among the best for the star trek series .  the action is plentiful and well done .  this is a very good-looking movie .  it should come as no surprise to anyone who ever watched star trek : the next generation that the acting is first rate .  it is very obvious that these actors have been working together for over a decade .  they interact with each other with a skill that few other ensemble casts can muster .  most star trek fans probably will not be disappointed with this latest film in the series .  if you've always hated star trek , there is nothing here that is going to change your mind .  star trek : insurrection is not the best film in the series , but it is good enough to dispel the long standing tradition of the odd numbered films in the series being far inferior to the even numbered ones .  
unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi , an artist whose palette is fabric .  ostensibly , the film is a documentary , but use of that term requires stretching its meaning .  many scenes appear staged , and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room .  the cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium , and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) .  director douglas keeve ( who was mizrahi's lover at the time ) freely admits that he " couldn't care less about the truth " but was more interested in capturing " the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion . "  despite violating nearly every rule of " legitimate " documentary film making , however , unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment .  while it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry , it presents a fascinating , if incomplete , picture of designer mizrahi .  this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study -- he's funny , energetic , and eminently quotable .  he has unusual views on just about everything , from fashion ( " it's about women not wanting to look like cows " ) to mary tyler moore ( " between her and jackie kennedy , they shaped this country " ) to style ( " it's almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs " ) .  unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress .  it's almost certainly different that anyone would imagine .  the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look , including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies , then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection .  in particular , unzipped traces mizrahi's development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show , which highlights a number of prominent models , including cindy crawford , naomi campbell , kate bush , and linda evangelista .  on the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped .  a variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color .  there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie , and , during the climactic fashion show , color is used to show the audience's perspective , while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences .  nevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment .  while unzipped isn't an expose on the fashion industry per se , keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear .  overall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else , and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed .  when the designer declares that " everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that's beautiful and liberating , " it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed .  
while watching wes anderson's rushmore , it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer , the film's anti-hero , was not written with jason schwartzman in mind .  the young actor , making his film debut as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman .  schwartzman plays max , a student who is more interested in his extra-curricular activities ( such as writing edgy plays like " serpico " and being president of the rushmore beekeepers ) but sees his grades suffer as a result .  on the brink of being thrown out , he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume ( the great bill murray ) to build an aquarium ( on rushmore's baseball field ) in her honour .  unfortunately for everyone involved , blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well , which gets in the way of max's plans to woo her .  max is one of the best-written characters we've yet seen in the 90s , and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age .  as everyone else has probably already pointed out , he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman ( although i was reminded more of paul from " the wonder years " , from a visual standpoint , at least ) .  hopefully , if he avoids typecasting as weird , quirky loner-types he should earn himself a good career .  bill murray is his equal as blume , displaying a depth we haven't yet seen from him .  while this isn't his best performance ( that honour goes to groundhog day ) he is still terrific here .  williams isn't given much to do except react to schwartzman and murray , but still does fine work .  rushmore seems to go just a little too long but , while it isn't a perfect film , it is a definate must-see for anyone who wants to see that rarity , an american coming-of-age film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality .  anderson has created a modern classic with a star who should , with any luck , rise to even greater success .  
capsule : this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii , life in a japanese prison camp .  to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity .  the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone's taste .   , +3 ( -4 to +4 )  more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way .  this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law .  during world war ii , of course , the one goal was winning the war .  this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal .  when the japanese had captured prisoners , they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal .  minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output .  while the germans , not known for their kindness in those days , had a 6% mortality rate among captured prisoners of war , the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27% .  the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad .  that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do .  the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day .  and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll .  in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany .  filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story , perhaps for fear of offending the japanese .  there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps .  certainly there was david lean's the bridge on the river kwai .  there were some low-budget british exploitation films and that was about it .  then there were tv series " a town like alice " and " tenko . "  lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa .  it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university .  the film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them .  the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad .  it turns out to be a grim joke , one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves .  beating and torture are commonplace events .  men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health ; it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable .  however , unlike as in kwai , the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital , called by the prisoners the death house .  so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail-laying machine .  this is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies .  the japanese believe that the individual is nothing , that conformity to group's norms is all that gives a life meaning .  conformity is purpose .  before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp .  if this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story .  if the british ( with one american , by the way ) and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story .  it is neither .  it is a stirring and believable account of camp life .  the color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow .  this serves a double purpose for cunningham .  it gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat .  it also creates a distancing effect .  the only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music .  this is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience .  i rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +3 on the -4 to +4 scale .  
trekkies , roger nygard's energetic and hilarious documentary , brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions .  the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non-fans alike .   ( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs . trekker polemic as not worth arguing about . )  the good-spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable , loud giggles , yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe .  denise crosby , who played tasha yar on " star trek : the next generation , " serves as the host .  in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary ( oed ) .   ( the oed cites a february , 1976 caption in the " new yorker " as the first recorded usage of the word . )  unless you've been to the conventions , i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans .  one pointed out , apologetically , that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate .  others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended , several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of .  my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams .  arguably the most famous of all the trekkies , she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die-hard fans do .  her claim to fame is that , as a juror on the whitewater trial , she wore it in court as well .   " every day i would walk past the reporters with a vulcan-like stoicism , " she says , describing her way of dealing with the crowd of reporters who became obsessed with her obsession .  she doesn't quite understand all of the uproar .   " i'm an officer of the federation 24 hours a day , " she reminds us .  her fealty to her hobby approaches that of a religious faith .  along with the laugher the show evokes , there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty .  and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment .  few other avocations could give this much satisfaction .  these people are having the time of their lives .   ( for the record , i'm not a star trek fan although i have seen some of the movies . )  the film interviews the various star trek series's stars as well as its fans .  the stars had thought the convention idea was a lark and would soon fade , but over twenty years later , the conventions are still going strong .  filled with anecdotes , the show talks about the happenings at the various conventions .  at one , the actor who plays q was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel .  after appearing briefly , he drank some water and left .  they decided to auction off his half-empty glass , joking that it had the " q virus . "  the guy who won the bidding immediately drank the water and screamed to the crowd that he now had the q virus too .  with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity .  not just flitting among people , the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies .  one guy is a trekkie cross-dresser , another dresses her cat , and then there is the dentist .  the dentist has his entire office made up to look like a star trek set .  he , his oral hygienists , his receptionist , his wife , and his kids wear the outfits all of the time .  it appears that his workers are permitted to take them off when they go home , but not his family .  for variety , he and his family do change characters from time to time .  he says his patients like it .  well , there was this one complainer , but he had a problem with his bill anyway .  there are summer schools for klingon with ph . d . linguists to teach the language .  hamlet is now available in klingon , albeit perhaps not at your local bookstore , and they are working on translating the bible .  they even sell united federation passports that are real enough that trekkies have used them to fool customs , even u . s . customs .  the movie bogs down only briefly when it tries to argue the series's larger meaning about diversity and humanitarian concerns .  sandwiched in-between the levity , the switch in tone doesn't work .  the incessantly up-beat film ends with a singing elvis impersonator .  he fits right in .  trekkies runs a breezy 1 : 26 .  it is not rated but would be pg for brief sexual references and would be fine for all ages .  
veteran actor clint eastwood has never looked as grizzled as he does in true crime , his latest directorial effort .  when steve everett ( his newest character ) gets angry at someone , he glares them down with those famous dirty harry eyes , furrows his brow and frowns like a grizzly bear who's just lost his cubs .  eastwood has played some particularly despicable characters in his time , but everett could just take the cake .  he gets my vote , at least , partly because `ev' is a drunken affair-a-week womanizer who has many relationship problems , very few of which are with his wife ( diane venora ) .  when his colleague at the oakland tribune is in an ugly car wreck and dies , everett must take over for her at a vital interview session .  the interview is with frank beacham ( isaiah washington ) , a death-row inmate set to die at midnight for the murder of a pregnant convenience store clerk .  eastwood furrows his brow .  as everett gradually finds information , he realizes that beacham could very well be innocent .  he interviews a key witness ( michael jeter ) , who claims that he burst in the door at pocum's foods because his car had overheated , only to see beacham standing over the dead woman's body , blood on his suspenders , gun in hand .  but everett protests : how could he have seen the gun , which was lowered by his side , with the potato chip rack in front of him ?  jeter doesn't know what he's talking about .  eastwood furrows his brow .  crinkled expressions and all , clint is the centre of energy of true crime .  the film is by no means a standard action/suspense yarn , but a thoughtful human story in which the characters come before the shoot-outs .  isaiah washington has a break-out performance as frank beacham , and scenes with him and his weary wife ( lisa gay hamilton ) are truly heartfelt moments .  but the best scenes are ones that feature eastwood duking it out with those in authority over him .  denis leary , as everett's editor and boss , has more than a few memorable moments of restrained anger ( you see , ev is sleeping with his wife ) .  but hands down , the most enjoyable segments of the film are when james woods is on camera .  playing the big boss alan mann , woods and eastwood create amusing chemistry and laugh-out-loud punchlines .  when true crime opts for a high-speed chase to the governer's house at the finale , the quality of film-making takes an abrupt nosedive .  eastwood was so successful with colorful character portraits that he didn't need to switch lanes .  true crime is a tension-building , intriguing drama showcase for the talented director and star .  this is a road block he could have easily dismissed ( i furrow my brow ) .   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities , but whom you end up liking anyway .  in as good as it gets , the character in question is melvin udall , a successful novelist with obsessive-compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible , except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you-know-where .  he's mean .  i mean really mean .  the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium .  every day , melvin eats at the same cafe , sits at the same table , and gets served by the same waitress .  you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance , when his waitress carol ( helen hunt ) tells him he can just go sit in another section , and all the other waitresses just cringe .  one day , melvin makes a comment that goes to far , and carol , genuinely hurt , comes down on him like a ton of bricks .  at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course , but is also the only person who can get to him , too .  another person who often crosses melvin's sights is simon ( greg kinnear ) , an artist who lives on melvin's floor .  aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city , simon has the added benefit of being gay , making him a prime target .  simon's friend frank ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , also gay , does not fare much better .  when simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment , he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital , and frank , who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor , intimidates melvin into watching after simon's dog while he convalesces .  this is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage .  an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in : melvin gets to like the dog , and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin's softening up to the world around him .  it doesn't happen overnight , but throughout the film , he bites his tongue here , cares a little there , and most miraculously , falls in love .  one of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others .  he's traveling terra incognita here , and it shows .  good performances are turned in by all principal players in this film , especially by nicholson and hunt .  they play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen .  greg kinnear , who is becoming known for his supporting film roles , is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon .  he gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist , and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels .  cuba gooding jr . performs with a hyped-up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear , and comes through with a near constant comic performance .  the screenplay , by mark andrus and james l . brooks , is clever , touching , and funny .  the best part about it , however , is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting .  melvin is a man we can't quite figure out , but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention .  carol is a working woman living with her mother , trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem .  simon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers , but who is still not accepted by much of society .  combined with the talent of the actors , these characters make the film .  the one noticeable area where the film is lacking , however , is the absence of cuba gooding , jr . through the second half .  his character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary , but the film ends before his return , leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved .  i would have liked to have seen more of his character in general , in addition to a part in the film's conclusion .  there's one actor , who will probably not be recognized by any awards , but who contributes greatly to many of the movie's best scenes and who deserves mention .  this is that little dog .  he plays such a pivotal role to melvin's character development , actually serves to forward the plot , and has some absolutely scene-stealing moments , that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal .  award or no , however , when even the dog puts in a good performance , you know you've got an outstanding movie .  
he has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , raised and cared for and imprisoned by his domineering mother .  she inspires his love and his fear , and instills in him a similar love and fear of jesus .  he has a rudimentary grasp of language , mouthing monosyllables and repetitions of his mother's phrases .  he is taught that the world outside is fatally poisonous ; his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the door .  he is 35-years-old in body , but a child in mind and spirit .  he is the premise for bad boy bubby , a defiantly original australian movie about a man called bubby ( nicholas hope ) who has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , etc . , etc . then one day his father ( ralph cotterill ) appears .  his father is a shabby down-at-heels priest who appears to have permanently misplaced his religion .  unsurprisingly , he is not thrilled with the way " his " boy has turned out .  he is , however , rather pleased at renewing his acquaintance with the mother ( claire benito ) , and , more to the point , her ample breasts .  soon they are copulating on the dingy couch , while bubby crouches , confused , in the next room , acutely aware that the mother who had devoted all her attention to him has a new interest .  bubby's relationship to the world may be warped , but it is at least stable .  the father's arrival disturbs his precarious balance , causing an oedipal conflict which ends--freud would be pleased--in violence and , as a result , freedom .  bubby intuits from his father's arrival that the air outside is breathable : he leaves the apartment , his past , his world , behind .  so far , so good .  the first thirty minutes or so of bad boy bubby , which bring us to this point , are quite brilliant .  the movie is at its best when its stays within the constraints of bubby's hermetic two-room universe .  it follows through unrelentingly on the implications of its premise : bubby is used by his mother for sex , he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat with cellophane , he is terrifed by the notion that jesus will beat him senseless if he sins .  it is grim and savage and appalling , but also strangely tender--de heer , having imagined a life as bizarre as bubby's , does not exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes , but simply empathizes .  he observes what it might be like .  the intensity of these opening scenes , with their minimalist mise-en-scene , immerses us in a claustrophobic environment which seems to be a decayed stratum of our own world , and owes much to david lynch's eraserhead , not least the ambient industrial white noise of the soundtrack .  for thirty minutes , the movie maintains the feel and mood of a reality that does not seem far removed from our own .  then de heer lets bubby out , brings him into contact with our world , and the film never quite recovers .  our unlikely hero finds himself in port adelaide , where he wanders the streets and meets people , where he suffers and learns and survives .  he is seduced by a young woman from a salvation army band ( how an anti-social half-wit with no sense of hygiene manages to get laid mere hours after his escape is not the sort of question the film encourages , wisely ) ; he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress ; he insults a traffic cop and is punched in the stomach ; he shares a few beers in the back of a truck with a rock group ; he is imprisoned and raped ; he becomes a translator for mentally handicapped people whose speech is impaired beyond comprehension ; he is loved by a motherly large-breasted nurse ( carmel johnson ) .   .   .  it goes on , by turns inventive , silly , tasteless , endearing , and sometimes all of these things at once .  de heer never seems to be sure how bubby should interface with the real world : the tone shifts , uneasily , from fable to realism to satire and back again .  the scenes which try to touch base with a believable version of reality are the weakest ; the film is best understood as a kind of parable , and , indeed , the religious implications of bubby's experiences are foregrounded : icons of jesus on the cross hang from the mother's walls , bubby dons a priest's collar stolen from his father , a church organ-playing atheist lectures him on the necessity of unbelief , the woman who redeems him is named angel .  the manifold stresses of our world do not shatter bubby's mind , do not fragment him into psychosis ; rather , the world accomodates him , and heals him .  although de heer's touch is at times overbearing , bubby's salvation is touching ; what seemd at first a harsh lesson in the damaging effects of the social construction of reality becomes a na ? ve humanist tale of improbable hope .  a hapless rock group write a song about bubby and sing it for him and so give him the gift of community .  he returns the favour when he steps on stage one night and becomes their frontman , turning the fragmented impressions of his experiences into performance art , and turning the band into a popular draw .  innocence triumphs .  bubby becomes a holy fool , an idiot savant , and graces us with wisdom .  it's a strange turn of events , but by now we shouldn't be surprised , because bad boy bubby ain't like other movies .  
allen , star of many a brian depalma movie in the early eighties , has a brief , throwaway part towards the end of " out of sight , " as the maid of a crooked financier .  in keeping with her past performances , allen wears little more than a green velvet victoria's secret ensemble which begs the question , did they really need a costume designer for this ?   " out of sight " is not likely to secure ms . allen the kind of plaudits bestowed upon pam grier , who likewise returned from out of obscurity to appear in another recent elmore leonard adaptation , " jackie brown , " but it is intriguing to see her name kicking off the " also starring " credits given her limited screen time .  the real stars of " out of sight " are george clooney ( " batman & robin " by way of " e . r . " ) and jennifer lopez ( " selena " ) , whose winning chemistry , coupled with steven soderbergh's freeze-frame directorial technique , help the film retain the charismatic charm of leonard's original work .  with the success of " get shorty " three years ago , filmmakers have realized that adapting an elmore leonard novel can be an easier proposition than trying to dream up a storyline from scratch .  in " out of sight , " clooney stars as jack foley , a career criminal who specializes in unarmed robbery--he just waltzes into banks and politely makes a withdrawal , claiming that his " partner " ( just another customer it so happens ) will shoot the manager if the teller doesn't comply .  for all of jack's nice-guy charm though , he's not very lucky .  his latest scam lands him in florida's glades correctional facility .  federal marshal karen sisco ( lopez ) coincidentally arrives at the prison just as jack and his buddy ( ving rhames , typically appealing ) are breaking out .  there's a brief struggle and jack bundles himself and karen into the trunk of the getaway car .  it's in these cramped confines , pressed intimately together , that jack and karen start falling for one another .  the mutual attraction continues as the couple on opposite sides of the law slip in and out of one another's grasp .  karen follows jack to detroit , where he's about to pull off another heist , this time a cache of uncut diamonds from incarcerated businessman richard ripley ( played by a toupee-sporting albert brooks , almost unrecognizable in the prison scenes ) .  it's during this final caper-gone-awry that allen makes her scant appearance .  clooney's range as an actor is limited , but he has undeniable charm .  lopez , too , is easy on the eyes , but she demonstrates more depth in her portrayal of karen , a tough yet tender professional .  she dispenses with hit men as easily as she out-maneuvers sleazy pick-up artists in a bar .  especially cute is a sequence in which karen fantasizes about jack in a motel bathtub .  admirably supporting clooney and lopez are don cheadle as fellow felon maurice 'snoopy' miller , steve zahn as the perennially stoned glenn michaels , and dennis farina as karen's dad , who affectionately buys her a piece .  add a couple of uncredited cameos from " jackie brown " cast members and " out of sight " proves to be a lot of fun .  not as hip and clever as " shorty , " perhaps , or as complex and colorful as " brown , " but loads of fun nonetheless .  
jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of expectation .  even though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited , the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation .  this is , after all , the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction .  to say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood , since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio , desperado , four rooms , and from dusk 'til dawn .  he was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide .   ( i'm willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him . )  tarantino contributed on and off screen to these films , but never took the director's helm .  nearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more , tarantino returns with a film he can call his own .  the film opens up with an homage to the graduate , with jackie brown ( pam grier ) on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her .  jackie is a flight attendant for air cabo , which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas .  this makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi ( samuel l . jackson ) who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico .  however , while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u . s . for ordell , jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus ( michael bowen ) and atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , who catch her not only with the money , but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs .  jackie didn't know they were in the package with the cash , but that's of no consequence to the authorities , who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted .  of course , dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish , ordell .  ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) to get jackie out of jail , but while max is immediately attracted to her , jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety , since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police .  sure enough , ordell shows up at jackie's apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good , but she " borrows " max's pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell .  instead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistol's chamber to ordell's head , jackie proposes a deal .  since ordell wants to get his money out of mexico , jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more , but this time for a more substantial fee : fifteen percent of ordell's half million dollars .  with a gun in his face , how can ordell not agree ?  by itself , this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film .  however , we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think .  jackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell , but she's also making a deal with the feds as well as with max .  the film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham , but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around .  instead , it's actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today's movies .  at least this film has a little imagination .  most of the performances in jackie brown are above par .  pam grier , of whom i had never taken notice before , plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable .  samuel l . jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control .  robert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy , trying to do his best . .  never mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guy's apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course .  he's just so down-to-earth , the nature of his job really doesn't occur to us , even when we're shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison , or when we see the tools of his trade .  in supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara , a recently paroled friend of ordell's , and bridget fonda as melanie , one of the girls ordell keeps around town .  unfortunately , de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between , and then they are mostly clipped sentences .  in this film , he's not really de niro , but stereotypical de niro , uttering things like , " little bit , " and " pretty much . "  fonda , on the other hand , plays the slightly spaced-out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness , such that even when she is annoying louis , we are taking her side .  as is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand , the dialog is quick and snappy .  it grabs our attention and is actually interesting , and in many respects , this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals ; the lines are a form of art in and amongst themselves .  don't count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera , however .  there's a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange , and he's not really sure what's happening , but by composing the scene just so , his realization of what's going on is felt simultaneously by the audience .  we look at the screen and think , " gee , that's clever , " and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on .  although tarantino isn't afraid to drag out a shot for dramatic effect , it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film .  there are shots where a character is simply driving , and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head .  this is a tribute to both direction and acting .  however , there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall , and she is looking for something ; desperately looking for something .  we get the idea of the frantic nature of her search , but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she's looking for , but instead hoping she'll just stop .  overall , viewing jackie brown is time spent well .  some flap has already been made about the language used in the film , but it's really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today .  in fact , one might even be able to say that the way in which these " offensive " words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness .  go see the film and see what i mean .  
why do so many children's films treat their target audience with utter contempt ?  too many of those who write or direct for children's movies assume that the kids just can't handle serious , thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues .   " the iron giant , " which was directed and co-written by brad bird , late of such animated series as " the simpsons " and " king of the hill , " assumes that not only can children handle such discussions , but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time .   " the iron giant " holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience , making it a film that's enjoyable for both children and adults alike .  hogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard-working single mother , annie ( jennifer aniston ) , in a small town in maine .  after staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away , hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception .  he comes across a giant robot ( vin diesel ) from space that eats metal for food .  after saving the robot , nicknamed the iron giant , from electric shock , hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts .  because of damage he suffered upon landing , the giant has forgotten what his original mission was , so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy .  realizing he can't just keep the giant in a barn all the time , and that the giant needs food , he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean ( harry connick jr . ) , an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time .  it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can't keep the giant a secret forever , because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security .  he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant , and takes up residence in hogarth's house as a lodger .  meanwhile , the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind .   " the iron giant " is exactly what family films ought to be , because it doesn' t talk down to its audience .  the story is simple , very simple , about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy .  it's very similar to the spielberg classic " e . t . , ' and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of " the iron giant . "  the film holds many of the better elements of spielberg's film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy .  the film delivers several serious messages , the most important of which is one's ability to choose one's own fate .  hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero .  the final sequence is touching and appropriate , though i won't give it away , i will say that very few will be disappointed .  the animation , while not up to disney standards ( what could be , after " tarzan " ? ) , is good enough to make you forget you're watching a cartoon .  the giant is computer-animated , while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way .  the characters' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible , but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief .  fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth , and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother .  harry connick jr . does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv's " frasier " ) as an army general called in by agent mansley .  unlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasn't ditched ) .  dean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations .  even the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia .  a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won't mind , but " the iron giant " has clearly put a little work into making the characters real , and it pays off .  the film isn't only around to deliver heavy-handed messages , though .  it's also very funny , and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy .  the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well , and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on " the simpsons " for many years .  a sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to " outlast " one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever .  the film even takes some jabs at america's nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war , satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to " duck and cover " in the event of a nuclear attack .   " the iron giant " has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films , and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing .  instead of seeing people get bonked on the head , we get well-timed , clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with .  when you get right down to it , " the iron giant " is no more than the story of a boy and his robot .  the story is so straightforward , so quaint , that it ultimately becomes charming .  though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person , when it comes to family entertainment , simple is the way to go .  it's akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word , but it's not the story that sets the film above others of its kind , but rather the elements that go into the story , namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue , which " the iron giant " has in spades .  
renown surrealist director , the 77-year-old frenchman alain resnais ( hiroshima , mon amour/last year at marienbad/m ? lo ) , has created a lighthearted musical played as an homage to britisher dennis potter and his pennies from heaven ( 1978 tv serial , 1981 movie ) and the singing detective ( 1986 ) .  the film follows potter's gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip-synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts .  he also follows the kind of sweet and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct , such as " the umbrellas of cherbourg " and " the young girls of rochefort . "  the tale has resnais's unique touches as a director to go along with his homage .  it is a satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person , and that there is a song in everyone's heart for every occasion .  what hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters , the songs are not memorable and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience ( the exceptions might be the edith piaf and maurice chevalier numbers ) , and the farce seems more banal than daring .  yet it is not without its striking moments and charms , such as when jane birkin does a cameo and sings one of her own songs .  also , the glossy amberlike photography added a very french romantic feeling to the story , while the mood of paris as being a place for love to flourish above all else , which has always been embellished in movie lore , comes through with flying colors .  it also does a good job of showing you the way paris is in the 1990s and in the way ordinary people exist there .  it tells the romantic story of six parisians who become intertwined with each other in their ordinary lives as they search for happiness .  they are the attractive sisters odile ( sabine az ? ma ) and camille ( agnes jaoui ) , with the older businesswoman odile married and decidedly set on a bourgeois life of material comforts .  she is married to the glum and laconic claude ( pierre arditi ) .  she once went out with a businessman , nicolas ( jean-pierre bacri ) , who left her 8-years ago and now shows up in paris and asks her help to find someone to rent a flat for his family .  simon ( andre dussolier ) works as a real-estate salesman and is trying to find nicolas a flat , in his spare time he writes radio plays .  simon's boss is the much younger , unscrupulous and arrogant marc duveyrier ( lambert wilson ) , who inherited the firm from his father and is the real-estate agent selling a more luxurious and larger flat with a better view to odile , but fails to tell her that a building project is going up soon that will block her view .  screenwriters and actors jean-pierre bacri and agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts .  jaoui's camille is a university scholar finishing up a ph . d .  in history , using for her thesis the study of 'the yeomen in the year 1000 at lake paladru . '  she works as a tour guide in the meantime and suffers from panic attacks , even though she appears to have outwardly perfect self-control .  on her tours for the last four years has been the much older simon , pretending to be doing research for his plays but really attracted to her , but not having the nerve to tell her this .  to his dismay , he finds out she is dating his mean-spirited but handsome boss , whom she meets when looking at her sister's new place and seeing him crying but not realizing that it was from a cold , not because he's so sensitive .  bacri as the classy nicolas , turns out to be now working as a chauffeur .  he is a hypochondriac with a history of depression who visits many doctors , until he finds one who tells him there is nothing wrong with him .  odile still pines for him , but he's married , telling her he expects his wife to arrive shortly .  love is 'the same old song' that makes the world go 'round , even when all the characters are liars and not exactly open to what their true motives are .  everything comes together in a bourgeois housewarming party for odile's place , as the characters reveal their true feelings and all their deceptions and neurotic impulses are either uncovered or about to be .  there's not a lot of bite to this satirical musical , but resnais has never made a bad film and is one of the best current french directors , if not the best .  this film is not one his great ones , but it still has enough pep in its light touches to be interesting .  it not only has an odd way for the characters to break into song but -- some males even sing in a female voice while some females sing in a male voice .  it is also interesting in the way it examines its characters' behavior as being similar in business as in love .  
the calendar year has not even reached its midway point , but that hasn't prevented columbia pictures from trotting out a lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscar-bait season .  bille august's high-profile adaptation of victor hugo's classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epic--handsome production values , strong performances by a top-notch cast , a literate screenplay--with one critically missing element : emotional sweep .  for those not familiar with hugo's original novel or the hit stage musical it inspired , the hook of les miserables essentially boils down to something like a 19th-century french-set version of the fugitive .  after serving 19 years in a prison work camp for stealing a loaf of bread , the brutish jean valjean ( liam neeson ) is paroled .  immediately upon release , he steals valuable silverware from a kindly bishop who takes him in for a night ; he is caught by authorities , only to be forgiven by the bishop , who lets valjean keep the silver to start a new life on the straight and narrow .  that he does , and in doing so breaks his parole , which sets the obsessively determined inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) , who was one of the guards in valjean's prison camp , on his trail .  thematically , however , les miserables is a story about redemption , which valjean finds through his dealings with two women , the hard-luck factory-worker-turned-prostitute fantine ( uma thurman ) , and her illegitimate daughter , cosette .  years after breaking parole , valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau , where he forms a warm friendship with fantine after saving her from an unjust arrest by javert .  valjean promises the gravely ill fantine he will rescue the young cosette ( mimi newman ) from her cruel caretakers , the thenardiers , and raise the child as his own .  the " father " and " daughter " eventually land in paris , where the teenage cosette ( claire danes ) falls for dashing student revolutionary marius ( hans matheson ) .  the decades-spanning story is the stuff that cinematic epics are made of , and the danish august turns in his most accomplished english-language work , following the underrated 1994 superstar soap the house of the spirits and last year's stylish but highly preposterous mystery smilla's sense of snow .  he and screenwriter rafael yglesias bring the sprawling tale into clear focus and keep the events moving at a brisk pace .  production designer anna asp , costume designer gabriella pescucci , and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables a sumptuous period look whose accomplishment is mostly matched by the efforts of the cast .  neeson is commanding yet endearingly vulnerable ; rush's finely modulated menace is far more rewarding than his overrated , oscar-winning theatrics in shine ; and thurman disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role .  the younger members of the cast fare less well .  danes is convincing as cosette , but her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes a distraction ; and matheson , while competent , is a less interesting robert sean leonard .  as technically adept and cerebrally engaging the film is , by the time les miserables was over , my emotions had only been superficially involved .  while i was touched by valjean's relationships with fantine and cosette , i was not moved .  not even reaching the " touching " level is the cosette-marius pairing .  my only previous experience with les miserables is with the musical ( as i am sure many others' is ) , and i was dismayed to see eponine , a friend of marius's who selflessly dies in the name of her unspoken love for him , almost completely jettisoned from this adaptation ( the daughter of the thenardiers , here she is only briefly seen as a child ) .  her presence would have added some much-needed conflict and emotional heft to the youthful romance , but i suppose august and yglesias felt one tragic heroine ( fantine ) was enough .  even so , as 1998 creeps into summer blockbuster season , les miserables is a thoughtful , well-made , entertaining film , one that will sate moviegoers hungry for a dose of drama before popcorn no-brainers invade the multiplex .  
in some regards , making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it .  try too hard , and it snaps ; but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther .  in simon birch , director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique : he takes advantage of caution and poise , but also risks his movie with a few bold steps .  in the end , he's not only holding an unbroken band , but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature .  there's no doubt about it : the film that johnson has crafted is rich .  he chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown , maine - leaves turn bright orange in the fall , the grass is a lush green , pure white snow falls in the winter , and the sky goes on forever .  the characters continue that turn : our two leads are simon birch ( ian michael smith ) and joe wenteworth ( joseph mazzello ) .  simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital , and by age twelve he's only two feet tall .  joe is the bastard son of rebecca ( ashley judd ) , and by age twelve he's ready to know who is father is .  naturally , the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together , from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball .  in a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith , simon birch is convinced that he's god's instrument , and there must be a reason he's so small .  joe doesn't quite buy it , but he sticks by simon ; the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each other's only true friends .  early on , the two meet up with ben goodrich ( oliver platt ) , rebecca's new boyfriend , and although the bond isn't immediate , ben and the two boys develop a liking for each other .  both platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability .  the audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon , a testament to the acting jobs of both .  finally , jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day , and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show .  mark steven johnson's sense of drama and writing is fantastic .  the script is loosely based on john irving's novel , a prayer for owen meany , but it's so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from 'based on' to 'suggested by . '  along those same lines , it's almost unfitting to compare the two ; johnson uses tension , humor , atmosphere , and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions .  by no means has he developed a project of similar popularity - gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks - but the winning idea remains the same .  simon birch is a different look at a different life , and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come .  in the present , however , it's an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at .  
 " the celebration " is one of an elite kind of films that is completely absorbant .  you know , where you sit down to watch it , and no matter what you've heard about it before , you just can't help but be totally drawn into its story and shocked by every single turn that occurs .  i prefer films like these because these are what the best kind of films are like .  i don't really feel there are to be any real " rules " for cinema ; a film can do anything , as long as it makes it work .  but i do ask that all films have one thing in common : they create experiences .  when i watch a film , no matter what kind of film it is , i want to be able to take certain memories along with me .   " the celebration " is great because it's chock full of those .  it creates a world so completely realistic that everything that occurs is as memorable as the little instances of life that catch your attention and stay with you for the rest of your life .  and then it makes things just a tad bit farscial , just to make sure you're paying attention , which you are because what transpires is just so goddam interesting that if you were to ever feel bored , then you're of your attention span needs a bit of a tuning-up .  the story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch ( henning mortizen ) , who has just turned 60 and is having a party thrown for him .  all his friends and family turn up , and for the first half hour , we get introduced to everyone , simplistically and realistically ( no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here ) .  the eldest son , christian ( ulrich thomsen , looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell ) , is the first to be seen in the film , walking to his father's home .  his brother , michael ( thomas bo larsen ) , drives by , pulls over , greets him , then kicks his family out of the car , forcing them to walk to the estate , just so christian can be comfortable .  we then meet helene ( paprika steen ) , their sister , a woman who always seems to be stressed-out , who invites the driver of her car ( gbatokai dakinah ) , an american , to to come join her at the party she's going to .  once they're all there and settled in , the party begins , and as custom , the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad , so christian stands up , at the head of the table , and reveals the film's punchline : his father raped all his children at a young age .  but since this is a family/friends affair , his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth , and is simply brushed off despite his efforts , and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir , and it's all terribly interesting to watch .  twists occur , and soon the film has taken on a nearly-farsical nature , but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends .  the most notorious thing about this film , which has been getting the most notice , though , is that the director , thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion .  as a member of the danish filmmakers clan , dogme 95 , a group that has vowed to oppose " the auteur concept , make-up , illusions , and dramaturgical predictability " so that they may " purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot . "  i have not seen " breaking the waves , " the other notable film by a member of this group ( lars von trier , to be exact ) , but " the celebration " works exquisitely in this department .  it feels like reality , like you're actually watching real people and not actors , and as a major pointer , has been shot on video .  as a result , it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film , but always wanted to .  we see key moments in people's lives that they wouldn't dare show to the world , and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style , as ironically-showmanship as it really is , works perfectly for the nature of the film .  the key , though , to this film , and the reason it's not just a cool danish import , is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth .  throughout the film , we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies , a debate so three-dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the-truth-at-all-costs reasoning out of the water .  of course it was not right for the father to rape his children , and of course , they couldn't have fought back then , and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them .  and yes , it's thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later , when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier .  but then again , the father , after all , is not a totally bad guy , and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier , we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he's done , and deep down , feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface .  the final scene , involving mortizen and everyone else , is utterly devastating , thanks to him and thomsen , whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex .  everyone else is flawless as well - the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them .  the actors or writers have not made the mistake to judge these characters in the slightest : there are no whites or blacks but instead all grays , exactly like life .  as such , " the celebration " may be the one truly bizarro film of the year : a work of art so eerily close to reality that it's utterly disturbing and utterly fascinating .  
 " footloose " has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel-good antics .  and i hate to admit it ; i fell for it .  the movie is about a teenager ( bacon ) who moves to a small town from the big city , and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend ( lithgow ) .  he ends up falling for the preacher's daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do .  as mentioned at the beginning of this review , " footloose " is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama .  there are virtually no surprises , and the writing is second-rate .  so why did i enjoy it so much ?  for one thing , the cast is great .  kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role .  we're rooting for him right from the start , and , unlike most films of this genre , bacon doesn't play him as the " rebel without a clue " sort .  yes , he does rebel , but he's also polite when he needs to be .  and he never broods .  the rest of the cast is equally impressive .  john lithgow , seen here playing a normal guy for a change , is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian .  but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter .  by the end of the film , we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character .  another nice touch is the music .  we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with " sexual innuendos " , but that's not true at all .  the title track , performed by kenny loggins , is upbeat and fun .  during the final sequence , i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing .  of course , i soon realized that would be a little pathetic .  anyway , " footloose " is a charming little surprise .  don't let the premise prevent you from watching it .  it sucked me in , and it'll do the same to you .  
plot : a group of asbestos cleaners get a job removing the gunk from an old insane asylum .  as each day passes , the crew members begin to discover things about the place and themselves which set other things in motion .  saying anything else about the plot would be a crime .  have fun . . .  critique : " i feel like shooting myself in the head " are the first words that came out of my mouth after seeing this movie , a good indication as to what kind of film to expect here .  this ain't your average " happy go lucky " kind of picture .  this is a deliberately slow-paced mystery-horror film drenched in atmosphere , with a very creepy insane asylum ( in which most of the film takes place ) , very few clues up-front and lots to talk about afterwards .  will it bore some people to sleep ?  you bet it will !  is it made for the scream audiences of the day ?  absolutely not !  i guess you can describe this film as a horror movie for the " cerebral crowd " .  a film that patiently unwraps itself frame after frame , giving away very little with each step and each sound , unwinding itself until its final scenes offer up a world of revelations and plenty more to discuss later .  i've always loved movies that have me talking about them afterwards like the shining and lost highway and this film fits right into that group .  in fact , i guess i can pussyfoot around the actual word all i want but the best way to describe this kind of movie is a " mindfuck " .  if you feel like watching a movie that moves very slowly , gives you a handful of characters with divergent backgrounds , tosses a few very ambiguous and supernatural cookies your way and is extremely disturbing once you put it all together , well , then this movie is definitely for you !  it's the kind of film that you actually have to see twice to fully appreciate ( damn , i missed that whole " peanut butter " thing ! ) and one that will likely creep the shit out of you if watched alone in the dark .   " brrrrrrrrr . . . now  what was that sound in the basement ?  honey , can you go check ? "  and one thing this film doesn't have , unlike its hollywood-ian counterparts like the haunting , is special effects .  in fact , that's one of the greater things about this movie : it feels real because it looks like it's actually taped on video with very credible actors in very credible circumstances ( i did some research and it was , in fact , shot on digital video . . . ah-ha ! ) .  another great thing about it is that it's actually very gory and somewhat violent in theme , and yet we rarely see anything of the sort on the big screen ( it's mostly implied , kids ! ) .  and as clich ? d as it might be to say . . . it's usually much scarier when stuff is left to our imagination or implied in movies as such .  other films that this one reminded me of include henry : portrait of a serial killer and the blair witch project , with that same real sense of dread , brooding and terror .  the film does however move awfully slow and if you really don't get " into " it completely ( you really need to concentrate here ) , you will lose the motion of the story and the pent-up tension might be released .  but overall , this film is yet another great example of the horror genre making a very cool comeback this year with no tight tanktops in sight .  and with david caruso acting like the king hotshot like only he can , how can you go wrong ?  definitely not a film for everyone but a must-see for anyone looking to throw themselves into the psyche of the disturbed ( count me in ! ) .  stanley kubrick would be proud !  oh yeah . . . so  where's that gun again . . . ?  where's joblo coming from ?  the blair witch project ( 4/10 ) - blair witch 2 ( 7/10 ) - the haunting ( 3/10 ) - the house on haunted hill ( 7/10 ) - lost highway ( 10/10 ) - the pledge ( 6/10 ) - the shining ( 9/10 ) - the sixth sense ( 8/10 ) - unbreakable ( 8/10 )  
in tim burton's `sleepy hollow' , there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name .  he rides a beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe .  burton's update on washington irving's classic tale of `the legend of sleepy hollow' offers us the mystery of the horseman , when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror .  writer andrew kevin walker ( `seven' ) throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes , but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing , as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine .  as `sleepy hollow' opens , we're greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau , who won an oscar in burton's `ed wood' .  landau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow , who , on a fateful carriage ride through the forest , is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider .  after two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town , constable ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is sent in to investigate .  landlord baltus von tassel ( michael gambon ) explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case , and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper ( played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken ) who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods .  crane is not a man of great superstition , and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets ( things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie ) .  first and foremost , `sleepy hollow' is a fun horror film .  as with virtually all burton movies , we are treated to a wonderful score by composer danny elfman , who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly .  the horseman f/x are stylish and impressive , particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors .  but why did i enjoy `sleepy hollow' as much as i did ?  although enjoyable , it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right . .  it was the light comic touch that burton applied .  the film has the sweetness of a candy apple , usually channeled through depp's wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane , who is no longer a mild-mannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities .  this is certainly not the only alteration that's been made .  as the film progresses , it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves .  the momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together , because for the audience , it's not an issue we particularly wish to be solved .  it's more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive .  still , we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and burton's keen eye to capture our attention .  the costuming is exceptional , and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout ( it's recognizable that the script was refined by award-winning playwright tom stoppard ) .  the supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many .  a blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassel's daughter katrina , and an unlikely romance between she and ichabod is surprisingly consistent .  walken , michael gough ( who appeared in burton's `batman' films ) and miranda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles .  i suppose the strengths behind `sleepy hollow' lie within the central trio : director burton , constable depp and the headless horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy .  all of this is not to be taken seriously , of course .  `sleepy hollow' is a lavish , frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale that many people cherished as children .  if you've got a decent head on your shoulders , you'll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time .  
 " psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred " .  a blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget , third rate rip-off .  but no , this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria , perhaps italian horror director dario argento's most consistently successful film .  what impresses most in re-watching this surrealistic , supernatural thriller is that argento's directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a near-fully coherent narrative .  screenplays have always been his achilles heel ; confusing subplots , gaping holes , totally illogical incidents and reactions .  no question : argento has always been a better director than a writer .  fortunately , he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria , taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called " suspiria de profundis " .  the film's storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic , provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches .  jessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance .  arriving at the school late at night in driving rain , she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state .  what happens next - and i don't make the comparison lightly - is a murder sequence that for intensity , shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock's infamous shower scene in psycho .  it's quite possibly a homage to hitchcock , but with its baroque sets , graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin , this stunning sequence remains very much argento's own .  though nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspiria's opening 15 minutes , the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school .  we meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters , most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious sour-old-matriarch-from-hell roles she does so well .  several more violent murders ensue , including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is . . . well , i wouldn't want to spoil things now , would i ? and the film's climax , staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms , has a gothic ghoulishness that's most impressive .  the english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming , and not just for the violence - deep red and phenomena , for example , have been appallingly hacked about .  fortunately , the cuts to suspiria ( about 7 minutes in this version ) have not adversely affected the film .  the dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done , too , excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with a conversation between harper and a professor about the history of witchcraft in the region .  and the soundtrack ?  it is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else .  as it stands , the use of goblin's music in suspiria is outstanding .  apparently , argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts .  a stereo video player adds greatly to the viewer's overall experience .  even better , see suspiria in a cinema , where you'll get the added bonus of widescreen .  and the colours !  deep reds , eerie blues , a superb use of shadow and contrast .  the cinematography of luciano tovoli , whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female , is uniformly superb .  a nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors .  these kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argento's more surreal excursions , the other most notable example being inferno ( 1980 ) on which bassan also worked .  suspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors , and it is fully deserving of its cult status .  the gore is at times a little excessive and overstated - that's always been one of argento's shortcomings - but overall this is a fascinating , compelling example of italian horror .  
one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction .  the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy , innocent fun .  sometimes the stories are compelling .  sometimes they're not .  but , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i've never been bored by any of the enterprise's numerous missions .  star trek : insurrection is no exception .  the film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks it's the worst in the series ) , but i'm not really sure why .  it's an exciting , often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film .  some say it's a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film .  others say the special effects are cheesy and that it's boring .  i simply enjoyed the film .  insurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called the ba'ku ; the ba'ku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old ) , but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet .  of course , these peaceful people can't horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ? leave it up to their archenemies , the son'a , led by ru'afo ( f .  murray abraham ) , to mess everything up .  the son'a , who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable , strike a deal with the federation to move the ba'ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying .  that's when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in : he realizes that moving the ba'ku would kill them ( it also helps that he falls in love with a ba'ku woman ( donna murphy ) ) .  so , with his trusty crew , picard defies the federation to keep the ba'ku in their natural habitat .  when dealing with a series with as much history as this , it's not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode .  this is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it , one has to understand how to approach it .  insurrection , however , does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters .  stewart is bold as always , a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together .  jonathan frakes , who also directed , is funny as commander riker ; a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain , overacting like crazy .  frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact ; insurrection is an exciting film , with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action .  this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation , and the result is very pleasing to the eye : particularly in the climactic scenes , in which the son'a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba'ku planet , the special effects have a clean , impressively sharp look .  if i have any complaint about the film , it's that it tries to take a moral stance when it's not very appropriate to do so .  i don't think it's that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba'ku in order to save the lives of thousands .  better yet , why couldn't they have co-existed ?  insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience .  with it's inherent camp factor , the star trek series doesn't seem well-equipped to deal with issues like this .  i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle .  
jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh box-sets on the video shelves -- he had a feeling that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the well-off .  maybe it's a classic case of displacement : it's easier to see jarvis' own lyrics ( obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the wall ) as a fetishization of lowlife , rather than leigh's films .  but it's worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of working-class characters don't make for a guarantee of 'authenticity' , let alone a good film .  it's the triumph of secrets & lies , then , that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common people into a probing of just what it means to seek 'authenticity' and honesty in everyday lives .  following her adopted mother's funeral , hortense , a young black optometrist , sets out to find her birth mother , and is disturbed to find out that she is white .  it is cynthia , a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne .  cynthia's younger brother maurice is a successful photographer who has not seen his sister for ages , largely because of his wife's animosity towards her .  hortense calls up cynthia , who initially breaks down in tears and refuses to see her .  but their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventually .  cynthia invites hortense to come along to a party , which maurice is hosting . . .  secrets & lies has a simple enough theme at its heart -- as one character puts it , " best to tell the truth , isn't it ?  that way nobody gets hurt . " .  but if the film delivers much more than a trite message , it's because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly truths , even while the evasions and unspoken grievances slowly choke us .  hence , cynthia's difficulty with acknowledging ( first to herself , then to others ) that hortense is her daughter .  one of her first reactions to seeing hortense is a sincere denial that she has ever " been with a black man " , before a long-suppressed memory seizes her .  at the party , cynthia's pretense that hortense is her factory co-worker leads her to ever more convoluted lies , as agonizing as they are funny .  little lies seep into every corner , like maurice pretending that he's " just dropping by " when he visits cynthia after much deliberation .  maurice's job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments on the main theme - a sad-looking bride that maurice coaxes to smile , a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring and argue about his spectacles .  one of the most startling images is of a beautiful woman with large scars on her face : she says she needs the photo to look " as bad as possible " to collect insurance money , yet the short scene leaves you wondering about what untold story lies behind the scars .  there are occasionally hilarious moments , as when cynthia attempts to give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception , " i've got a dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs " ; or when cynthia stares at her own rather pedestrian legs and tells roxanne , " if you've got it , flaunt it , is what i say . "  as played by brenda blethyn , cynthia comes close to being a caricature , with her nervous , somewhat disconnected way of talking .  but she's really just right for the role of someone who inspires sympathy and yet strains the tolerance of those around her , precisely because she's so needy of love , perhaps .  indeed , the whole cast gives warmly rounded , detailed performances .  the script was developed partly through improvisations , and the fusion of cast , script and director shows best in the party scene - seemingly everyone is talking at the same time , and yet many subtle observations are being made throughout .  in a very different way , but also using a long single shot , the scene of hortense and cynthia's first meeting in a lonely caf=8a achieves a touching intensity , all the more for their reticence and unspoken feelings .  the film's climax - with all the secrets and lies finally spilled out in ibsen-esque revelations , and everybody hugging each other - is the one thing that seems false about this film .  however , it's a film that truly earns its happy ending after the misery and repression of the character's lives .  when cynthia says near the end , this is the life , innit ? , you get the sense that , following the cynicism of his last film naked , leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all , without comforting illusions .  the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .  
what do you get when you slap together a movie based on a story by the legendary george lucas , directed by virtuoso director steven spielberg , and starring one of the biggest box-office stars in the world , harrison ford ?  you get one hot-fudge-rockin' good time , that's what you get ! ! !  plot : professor/archeologist indiana jones sets out to find the long-lost mystical ark of the covenant before the nazis get their grubby fingers hands on it .  adventures , snakes , romance and mucho action ensues .  critique : astounding movie packed with non-stop action , stunts galore , an interesting story line , great one-liners , a solid cast , a catchy musical score , and all the fun and adventure that you could squeeze into a two-hour thrill ride .  if you don't enjoy this film , then you just don't like action movies , period !  if you're young , you'll enjoy its humor , its cool action sequences and its gross-out factor at times .  if you're a little older , you'll appreciate the interesting plot line , the romance , and yes , the mountains of adventure .  watching this movie made me feel like a kid again , dreaming and fantasizing about fighting the bad guys , travelling to different countries , making the impossible , possible !  harrison ford is perfect as the every-man with the brains of a scientist and the brawn of an outdoors adventurer , and spielberg manages to achieve the ideal balance of action , fun , adventure and humor .  now if you really want to have a good time , check into this movie on the same night as its two sequels , rent a jug of iced coke , truckloads of nachos and salsa , an adventure hat and whip , and prepare to gag yourself into a world of action-movie heaven !  little known facts about this film and its stars : this picture was nominated for eight 1981 oscar nominations , including best picture .  it lost that award to chariots of fire , but did manage to win for best art direction , best special effects , best film editing and best sound .  actor tom selleck was originally cast as indiana jones , but was committed to his hit tv show , " magnum p . i . " .  in filming the well of souls sequence , the producers scoured every pet shop in london and the south of england for every snake they could lay their hands on .  hence there are snakes that are identifiable from many different geographical areas .  however , once all the snakes were on set , it became clear that there were not nearly enough of them , so spielberg had several hoses cut into lengths , and these were used as well .  looking closely , you can tell which are the real snakes and which are not .  an early draft of the script had indy travelling to shanghai to recover a piece of the staff of ra .  during his escape from the museum where it was housed , he sheltered from machine gun fire behind a giant rolling gong .  also in the same script , indy and marion flee the chaos caused by the opening of the ark in a wild mine-cart chase sequence .  both of these scenes were cut from the script , but ended up in 1984's indiana jones and the temple of doom .  this film begins with a shot of a peak in the jungle which is reminiscent of the paramount pictures logo .  the same type of opening is present in its sequels .  jock's airplane at the beginning of the film has the registration number " ob-cpo " .  this is a reference to obi-wan and c-3po from george lucas' star wars ( 9 . 5/10 ) .  also , the hieroglyphics in the well of souls include engravings of r2-d2 and c-3po .  they can be seen on a post to the right of indy and sallah as they remove the ark .  the script originally included a long fight between a swordsman and indiana with his whip .  as legend has it , actor harrison ford was suffering diarrhea at the time , and asked if the scene could be shortened .  spielberg said the only way he could shorten it was if indy pulled out his gun and just shot the guy .  the entire crew laughed and that's how it was filmed .  when indy first falls in the well of souls and is face to face with the cobra , you can see the snake's reflection on the glass dividing it and harrison ford , also some fingerprints and stuff like that .  when indy is dragging along the ground , hanging onto the nazi soldier's truck with the ark inside , you can see the pad that he's being dragged on .  
historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s .  for many critics , scholars and , most importantly , film producers , it was a thing of the past - something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black-and-white television and non-cgi special effects .  but in 1995 , same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago , there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor , producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre .  and , same as in the case of dances with wolves , he was awarded for his effort with " oscars " .  the name of the film was braveheart , and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson .  the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace ( 1272 - 1305 ) .  in his time , english king edward i " longshanks " ( played by patrick mcgoohan ) has almost completely subdued entire british isles , including scotland , whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by " ius primae noctis " and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights .  although english had killed his father many years ago , young scottish commoner william wallace ( played by mel gibson ) doesn't care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron ( played by catherine maccormack ) .  murron's death changes that and wallace takes arms and , together with small but dedicated band of followers , begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country .  through time , more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace's rag-tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge .  but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves , especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce ( played by angus macfadyen ) , who wouldn't like to have a simple commoner as a national leader .  braveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson , so it wouldn't be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann .  however , even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre .  the most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism .  while older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale-like vision of picturesque castles , splendid costumes and knights in shining armour , gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard , short and brutish .  this general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle , where hand-to-hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details , never seen since verhoeven's ultra-naturalistic flesh & blood .  compared with this naturalistic approach , most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays .  braveheart also employs humour at the right places , not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences , but also to underline its down-to-earth atmosphere , so different from previous historical epics .  what makes braveheart " larger than life " is his protagonist .  mel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and , as a result , character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero .  wallace is more than superior to his enemies , both physically and mentally , yet he is able to show his sensitive , more vulnerable side .  naturally , when the character is based on epic poems , most of historical accuracy is going down the drain ( which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s ) .  however , even those who don't particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace , especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel ( played by sophie marceau ) and make her a child .  because of that the disbelief is hardly suspended , and final scenes aren't as effective as they should be .  mel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful , and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors .  most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan , whose cold , calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema .  brendan gleeson ( who would later become famous for his role in boorman's general ) is also very good as wallace's trusted companion , as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy-stricken king john balliol .  david o'harra is very entertaining as wallace's irish ally , and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience-stricken character of robert the bruce .  women in this film have rather thankless roles , especially marceau as one-dimensional french princess .  catherine mccormack as wallace's wife was more interesting , but she was eliminated from the picture early on .  from the technical point of view , the film is also very good .  photography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen .  on the other hand , the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern-day instruments for period piece set in medieval times .  although mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike , braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism .  the main reason for that was the fact that gibson , among many historical facts , chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of " longshank " 's son prince edward ( played by peter hanly ) .  he is not only presented as a villain , but also as one of the less competent in villain's camp - and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in " politically correct " hollywood .  to make things even more obvious , good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward - rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives' common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals .  however , although the message of this film might look right-wing , it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century .  according to that ideology , oppressed classes ( workers , peasants ) are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and , as such , they are more radical , less willing to make compromises and more efficient ; on the other hand , privileged classes ( aristocracy , bourgeoisie ) are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges .  this marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety .  in the end , whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic , braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre .  
plot : a peculiar french girl grows up lonely with her father and doesn't quite know what she wants out of life .  one day , she falls upon something , and believes that her ticket to happiness may be in helping others .  she starts with the people around her , but when she suddenly falls for her own guy , she can't act strongly enough because of her shy and dreamy nature .  critique : a clever , quirky , original french flick set in a picturesque paris , featuring an endearing lead with a giant imagination , much loneliness and a little bit of love for everyone .  this is a " feel-good " kind of movie , a fairy tale for grown-ups who are bummed out about life .  it doesn't pretend to be deep , it doesn't weigh itself down with long expositions or intricate studies of its characters , it's basically just a " cute movie " in the same vein as chocolat and pay it forward , with some amazing visuals and incredibly nice intentions ( and if chocolat was somehow able to nab an oscar nomination for best picture last year ( a sham on so many different levels ) , you might as well slap this film up for consideration also , since it's quite a bit better and much more original than the former ) .  one thing that this film isn't though , at least according to me , is the best film of the year ( it was bestowed the honor of " best " in at least 3 different film festivals so far this year ) .  it actually managed to stagnate a little bit about halfway through and it just went on for way too long ( it's a little over two hours but it felt even longer ) , with much of the second half of the movie devoted to many different characters , all of whom weren't as interesting as the lead , and a lot of indecisiveness from ms . amelie herself , which got frustrating .  thankfully , this film doesn't bog itself down with too much of that stuff , and actually goes out of its way to invent new ways to shoot scenes , to integrate moments of fantasy into its fabric and to transport the audience inside the imagination of this kind-hearted french girl .  on the whole , it's a lot of fun and it carries a beautiful message of love and support for your fellow man .  the lead , audrey tautou , is perfect for the role , and gives you enough moments of truth to develop her character into someone that you care about by the end of the film .  unfortunately , the rest of the cast isn't as well-developed , and even though most of them are pretty appealing , a couple could've been left out to save time and at least one was left stranded plot-wise , by the film's end ( what happened to the guy in the caf ? who was spying on his ex-girlfriend the whole movie ? ) .  now i haven't seen too many recent french films , i will admit , but if this is the kind of " scene " that they're developing over in " le pays du vin " , i wouldn't mind catching more of their flicks in the future ( crimson rivers was another french film that i saw earlier this year , which i really liked- ironically , that film was directed by mathieu kassovitz , who is the co-star in this film ) .  granted , the english subtitles got a little tough to keep up with at times ( i speak and understand french also , but some of the local colloquialisms went over my head ) , especially since the film's visuals were so intriguing that you just couldn't help but constantly gawk at them , but the general idea , the background music , the nifty french neighborhoods , the very creative way of enveloping the audience into the story-line from the start , were all very easy to appreciate , and i for one was especially glad to have seen this movie during these trying times in the world .  in fact , i'd recommend it to anyone looking for a jolly ol' time at the movie house , with a particular emphasis on folks with a lot of imagination , a little loneliness in their lives and many dreams in their hearts .  and this guy directed alien : resurrection ?  get outta here ! !  note : i especially loved the way that the script detailed and showed the loves/hates of everyone with exact mentions in the film .  it was very original , very well shot and very nostalgic , as many of us were able to relate to the behaviors described .  good stuff !  where's joblo coming from ?  chocolat ( 6/10 ) - crimson rivers ( 8/10 ) - ghost world ( 9/10 ) - like water for chocolate ( 8/10 ) - o brother , where art thou ( 7/10 ) - pay it forward ( 5/10 ) - rushmore ( 9/10 ) - woman on top ( 7/10 )  
when i first heard that kevin costner was making a movie called " the postman , " i thought , " an american version of 'il postino ? '  starring costner ?  god help us ! "  when i found out that it was not a remake of " postino " but an postapocalyptic epic , i thought , " 'landworld ? '  please , god , make him stop ! "  as it turns out , " the postman " is a much better film than i had expected .  despite being set in 2013 , the movie is , at heart , a western : a band of thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers ; a wandering hero opposes the bandits and inspires others to fight back .  the setting , however , allows that familiar plot to take on greater significance : american society has collapsed due to plagues and wars , and survivors live behind barracades in isolated villages .  the struggle of a dead society to be reborn has a grand quality and deserves the epic scale costner grants it .  costner's nameless character , a wandering actor , rides in from the vast wasteland and is soon shanghaied into the service of general bethlehem ( will patton ) , a former copy-machine salesman turned bandit king .  our hero escapes and discovers the body of a dead postman .  taking the uniform and bag of mail , he passes himself off as a representative of " the restored united states . "  he is shocked at the hope that he inspires in the people he meets .  one young disciple , ford lincoln mercury ( larenz tate ) , organizes a full-scale postal service .  ford spreads the postman's message of hope until bethlehem finds that the once-meek villagers are beginning to resist his rule .  as war breaks out between bethlehem's army and the postal workers , costner's character steps into the legend he created and goes from self-centered loner to leader of the revolution .  his lie of the restored united states becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy .   " postman " is an odd blend of a bleak setting and a message of wide-eyed optimism ( sort of " sergio leone meets frank capra " ) , but its treatment of hope and renewal is compelling .  what could have been another knock-off of " the road warrior " ( like " waterworld " was ) surprises the viewer with a sensitively told story of nobility emerging from rubble .  tate is the stand-out in the movie's large cast .  ford lincoln mercury ( self-named ) is the polar opposite of o-dog , tate's character in his debut film , " menace ii society " ( 1993 ) , and tate makes ford's innocent belief in hope as convincing as o-dog's cynicism and brutality .  his performance sells the movie .  interestingly , as tate moves from his usual street-smart roles to youthful optimism , the soft-eyed patton , who usually plays nice guys , proves a disarming villain .  olivia williams makes her film debut as the postman's love interest , abby .  when they first meet , abby asks him to father her child because her husband is sterile .  predictably , the husband is soon eliminated by the bandits , and abby is thrown back into the company of the hero .  however , their relationship develops slowly as the emotional conflicts of both characters are explored ( she , torn by grief , guilt , and anger ; he , resisting his destiny ) .   " the postman " is costner's best work thus far .  perhaps that alone gives us hope for the future .   .   .  
i guess it's a credit to jackie chan and the general likeability of the franchise that rush hour 2 could not be ruined even by the nauseating " comedy " of chris tucker .  i'm a fan of jackie chan in just about any medium , and this movie lets him not only do his impressive-as-ever martial arts schtick , but show off his comic timing as well .  it would have worked better if he was the only name above the title .  the plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts and special effects .  this time around , the evil smugglers are led by ricky tan ( john lone ) , who makes his fortune by shipping counterfeit money into the united states ( i'm still not sure how you can make a fortune doing that : is there a place where one can exchange fake bills for real ones ? ) .  the only way to tell the phony money from the genuine article is to set it on fire and see what color it burns .  of course , it's up to hong kong detective lee ( chan ) and trash-talking lapd detective james carter ( tucker ) to take the bad guys out and the authorities , to the extent that they even exist , stay out of their way .  rush hour 2 turns the tables on the first film in that here it's carter who gets the two of them into trouble and lee who winds up having to get them out .  i guarantee that my rating would have been at least a half of a grade higher had anyone other than chris tucker been cast as the foil for jackie chan .  he refuses to shut up .  not only did his voice feel like a jackhammer on my head , but his jokes just aren't funny , a pathetic mixture of sub-par eddie murphy fasttalking blather and wannabe chris rock white-man-black-man jokes that wind up being more offensive than funny .  i realize that in a movie like this some of the biggest laughs come from letting the actors ad lib beyond what the script dictates , but didn't anyone realize how irritating tucker's incessant ranting and raving was ?  if this is all the comedian has to offer then i don't care to see any more of his films .  fortunately , chan makes for a marvelous straight man , and he redeems the fledgling comedy completely .  it's not often that one actor can so completely save a movie , but there is no other name for what he does ; whenever he's on screen , rush hour 2 comes to nearly breathtaking , often hilarious , life .  much of it hinges on the dubious value of how cute it is to watch chan try to be a " player , " but who cares ?  i can think of few high concepts that are funnier .  the movie ends with outtakes that , as usual , show that chan isn't perfect , and that it does , indeed , take him a few tries to get some of his incredible stunts to look seamless .  chris tucker botches some lines as well , and his mistakes are funnier than anything he says in the whole movie .  a lot of people have pointed out rush hour 2 isn't very different from its predecessor in tone or style .  but i liked the original , and i like the sequel , though a certain sidekick seems to have done his best to ruin it .  director brett ratner ( the family man ) keeps it moving at an entertaining pace and manages to keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable hit to miss ratio of the jokes ( i guess sometimes the shotgun approach works ) .  it's not great jackie chan , but it's jackie chan , and that's enough .  up next : jay and silent bob strike back  
for example , in happy gilmore , sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a self-confident jerk of a pro .  if the star were any other comic , that would be enough motivation to drive the movie , but with sandler , the rookie also wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her house .  that extra motive doesn't make happy gilmore a funnier movie .  it doesn't really add any genuine emotional depth , either .  in fact , the motive is almost totally irrelevant to the movie .  but sandler's philosophy seems to be , if it's a token gesture , why not make it a nice gesture ?  that is endlessly refreshing .  in the wedding singer , sandler is right on track .  the fact that he's a wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story .  what kind of a wedding singer he is is even less important .  david spade could have filled the role with cynicism and sarcasm .  he could make fun of the fat , ugly , or embarrassing people he meets at weddings , and the story would be intact .  but sandler instead brings a mature goodness to the character .  he seems to really enjoy the people at weddings and treats them as though they were his own family .  robbie hart ( sandler ) doesn't just sing at weddings ; he also gets the loners to join in and have fun , and he smooths it over when someone does something embarrassing .  he is exactly the man you would want at your wedding .  the day comes when robbie has his own wedding , and he is stood up by his heavy-metal bride ( the movie is set in 1985 ) .  robbie takes it hard .  he doesn't sleep , he doesn't eat , and he gets punched out at work when he sings " love stinks " at a wedding .  julia ( drew barrymore ) , who waitresses all the weddings in town , gives him a shoulder to cry on and an ear to talk to .  eventually , robbie starts rebounding toward julia .  he really likes her , but she's engaged .  her fianc ? is a self-confident jerk ( do i see a trend - nope , just a formula ) who doesn't deserve her , but robbie is too depressed to fight for her hand .  julia seems to like robbie too , but she can't leave her seemingly safe and stable fianc ? for the off-chance that robbie might be serious about her .  you know the story .  you've seen it a million times before .  there's always a new way to tell it , with new lovers , new chemistry , and new details , but it's the same story .  and sometimes , it works .  the wedding singer works .  first of all , the chemistry between sandler and barrymore is effective .  actually , it's not so much the chemistry between the two as it is each one's own romantic tension .  sandler captures the forlorn sleepwalking look of a jilted man , struck with an unattainable love .  barrymore is charming as the girl next door looking for someone serious to settle down with .  sparks don't fly when they kiss , but they both seem right for each other .  second , their love is mature .  they are not driven by passionate sexual attraction - they're a cute couple , but neither sandler nor barrymore is centerfold material .  instead , they are both looking for someone meaningful , someone to settle down with , someone to grow old with .  at a wedding , robbie comforts a kid throwing up in a dumpster while julia sits by .  the repulsing situation is taken in stride , as if the two were already parents , caring for their sick child .  the ? 80s soundtrack and references play a big part in this movie .  other critics liked this movie in part because of the '80s soundtrack .  i liked it in spite of the soundtrack .  often , the music and references felt forced .  for example , robbie tells his ex-fianc ? to " get out of my van halen t-shirt before you jinx the band and they break up . "   ( ha ha ha .  get it ?  david lee roth did leave van halen ! )  or how about when sammy ( allen covert ) , robbie's chauffeur friend , shows up at a party wearing a michael jackson jacket and - get this - a single silver glove .   ( that's exactly what mj used to wear all the time ! ) .  unfortunately , making fun of generalizations about a past era is too easy to be rewarding .  that's not to say the movie isn't funny .  screenwriter tim herlihy has written for sandler before ( billy madison and happy gilmore ) , and the two make a good combination .  herlihy knows what sort of jokes sandler is good at and has tailored the script to his straight-faced , smart-aleck style .  let's hope herlihy and sandler stick together for a few more projects because this movie really won me over .  with barrymore's charm and sandler's heart , it was hard to go wrong .  
with the abundance of trite , recycled movies in the late '90s , there is a tremendous demand by movie lovers ( never mind movie critics ) for movies that present the wide film audience with something truly original : perhaps audaciously , perhaps purely thematically .  for the former , you need look no further than director tom tykwer's incredible german thriller run lola run , a movie that may make some viewers need a cooling off period afterwards .  lola , a contemporary goth-girl with blazing red hair receives a desperate phone call from her boyfriend manni one day .  it seems that because she was late delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundred thousand marks , and if he doesn't deliver a hundred thousand marks within the next twenty minutes , he will be killed .  this gives lola twenty minutes to come up with 100 , 000 marks , or her boyfriend dies .  so she runs -- not just jogs , sprints -- in hopes that somehow , someway , she'll be able to obtain the money and save a life .  >from there , as critic steve rhodes described it , run lola run plays a bit like " sliding doors on steroids .  with a non-stop techno soundtrack , wierd camerawork , all kinds of insane zooms and a truly breakneck pace , anyone that is bored with run lola run has to be smoking something .  indeed , the movie is often outrageously exciting , as well as bitterly ironic and subtly serious .  very much like titanic , run lola run is an achievement with filmmaking much more than it is an achievement in film .  the way the movie is made , for pure visual style , tykwer's movie is breathtaking ( literally , sometimes ) .  thematically it does leave something to be desired ; it toys around with some intriguing ideas but does occasionally seem as if there is little substance behind all of the flash .  while you are watching , this will not matter .  running a breezy 81 minutes , this is one movie i wished was longer because it was so damn good while it lasted .  it is the equivalent of a roller-coaster in the amount of thrills and fun that it offers .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;  
in this good natured , pleasent and easy going comedy , bill murray ( ghostbusters , 1984 ) plays grumpy weatherman phil conners , who , every year , is sent to punxsutawney , p . a , to report on groundhog day .  the groundhog day ceremony involves a groundhog being lifted out of a box , and if he dosen't see a shadow , it will be an early spring .  phil really hates the ceremony , and not even his producer rita ( macdowell ) can change his mind .  however , fate has a cruel trick for phil , and he starts re-living groundhog day over , and over , and over , until he gradually likes it , and rita falls in love with him .  groundhog day is a well written , totatly unoffensive and funny comedy .  the screenwriters , director ramis and danny rubin , have written a funny , warm , but never overly senitmental comedy .  although the idea of a day repeating over and over may sound tedious , there are enough good jokes to hold the audiences attention throughout the whole film .  ramis's direction also helps , and although he dosen't try any flash director tricks , the film is directed well enough , and the jokes are set up well .  and the editing is also good , especially when it shows one part of the day over , and over again , such as when phil tries to have the perfect night with rita .  the performances are also excellent .  bill murray is great fun , and his transistion from cynical to happy is smooth , and delivers his lines in his usual smary style .  andie macdowell is good as rita , although sometimes she is just a little bit too sweet in some parts of the film .  there is chemistry between the two leads , thankfully , otherwise the whole film would probably fall part .  chris elliot , as the cameraman larry , is also funny , although you have to like his goofy style , otherwise you are really going to hate him throughout this film , and it will lower your enjoyment of the film overall .  the supporting cast aren't bad either , with stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils old school mate ned ryanson , and even director ramis popping up as a neurologist .  in fact , there is not one dud performance in this film , and even the groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase .  overall , there is really nothing wrong with groundhog day at all .  it almost seems perfect .  however , the film can get a bit soppy sometimes , and some people may get irritated by the day repeating over , and over , and over , and over .  also , there's not much of an music score , and the music there is is pretty bad .  but these criticisms hardly affect the audiences enjoyment at all .  overall , then , groundhog day is a funny , smart , and also has some room in there for some heart .  an excellent comedy .  overall rating= (  
taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking , go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers .  the story centres around a group of people , who include brit simon ( askew ) , and checkout girls claire ( holmes ) and ronna ( polley ) and the misadventures that they get into , split into three chapters .  everything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers .  although qt's touch is evident in nearly every frame , go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride .  liman , who also photographed the film , has a deft touch with the camera , and the film looks good .  the film also seems to have benefited from a budget , with the night-club scenes in particular looking pretty good .  there's a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk .  the young cast are talented and help bring the story to life .  holmes , one of the dawson's creek cast ( a show i'm not particularly fond of ) displays much talent here , and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature .  askew is slightly successful , being rather obnoxious .  no doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him , but instead of 'funny annoying' he's just annoying .  he drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters , but the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it .  the real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl : her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining .  also entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer , who gives an nice evil performance .  the script , written john august , is sharp and witty , with good dialogue and some funny jokes .  it starts off rather slow however , but in about twenty minutes the script has found it's footing and just keeps getting better .  the stories are largely satisfying , although occasionally there's too much attention on one detail but not on another .  also , some of the endings seem a little forced and lucky .  still , the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it .  it could of tried a little harder in some parts however , and these parts lag .  because this is a gen-xer movie , the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany , and go's one is pretty decent .  unlike other gen-xers movies , go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue , which is a plus .  go is a very easy movie to absorb into , and the audience really starts feeling for these characters .  thankfully , they never become two dimensional characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics ( like the heroine in 10 things i hate about you . )  they are who they are and they stay that way .  go is great fun , and a worthy follow up from the director of swingers .  ignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction and very bad things , and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride .  erm , go to go , i guess .  
a wonderful little movie that is really interested in its characters and in its theme .  the scene of " second best " is laid in wales .  james ( chris cleary miles ) is a 10-year-old boy who must live in a home because his father ( keith allen ) is in prison and his mother committed suicide .  james is a mentally unbalanced child .  he can't forget what happened in the past , and he dreams of living a happy life with his beloved father .  in the home he feels sadly and lonely .  one day , a social worker ( alan cumming ) tells him of a person who wants to adopt him .  this person is graham holt ( william hurt ) .  graham manages a post office and shop in a village .  he is a single and hasn't any real friends .  his mother is dead , and his father is ill and will die .  graham feels that he has been a disappointment to his parents .  there has never been real love between his parents and him .  graham's monotonous life would get a new sense if he could adopt james .  but graham has not only to convince the institutions , but must also win the love of james .  james and graham have to open theirselves .  they must get to know each other and learn to understand and trust the other person .  james and graham aid each other to cope with their problems .  but will their relationship really have a future ?   " second best " is based on a novel by david cook who also wrote the screenplay .  the film was directed by chris menges who had made his directing debut with the very good anti-apartheid drama " a world apart " ( 1987/88 ) .  and maybe , " second best " is even a greater picture .  this precise , richly detailed , sensitively and convincingly directed study about a special adoption treats its theme with great seriousness .  the breathtakingly intense film shows the necessity of human contact and communication .  william hurt delivers an outstanding performance as graham holt .  and chris cleary miles is remarkably convincing in the role of the boy .  the supporting cast is also fine ( especially jane horrocks as debbie , a social worker who is charged to examine graham's living circumstances ) .   " second best " is an underestimated masterpiece .  it's a pity that films like this one are made so seldom .  i eagerly await menges' next directorial work , " the lost son " , which will star daniel auteuil .  
you've heard all the hype .  you've seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler's list ) as qui-gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi-wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker .  if you've read any reviews , you've also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy .  you also may have heard that this one's too kiddie-friendly , and doesn't have enough content for adults .  believe the hype .  the effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic , the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala's sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth .  but there's something missing here , and it isn't budget or effects - it's everything money * can't * buy .  the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters .  the most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui-gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence .  he is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out .  portman's queen amidala and mcgregor's obi-wan kenobi don't fare nearly so well .  amidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) .  and obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he's nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn's batman .  however , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job .  he also absolutely nails alec guiness' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise .  in fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that's one of the problems with this film .  i would never call myself a " star wars " fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i've always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america .  however , if you are the one person in america who * hasn't * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn't bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost .  for example , one of the film's main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine .  for those of you not recently steeped in " star wars " trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader's master in " return of the jedi " and " empire strikes back . "  so , obviously , his appearance in " phantom menace " is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful .  a lot of the movie is like that .  r2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it's obvious that lucas is banking on the audience's pre-existing fondness for them . . .  because he doesn't do much to add to it in any way .  same goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn't look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy .  even * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from " empire strikes back " ) , and alderaan ( leia's home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in " star wars " ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing .  what's the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ?  the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty .  there's no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be .  another problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film .  i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters .  and jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast .  unlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you'll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive " teenage mutant ninja turtles . "  furthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot .  oddly , this isn't just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids .  well , he's done a good job .  the hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy .  that's not jake lloyd's fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him .  that's another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader .  warning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! !  in my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin's future evil in the film .  the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there's nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie .  he has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine .  but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn't all hearts and roses is yoda's hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn .  his explanation ?   " his future is clouded . "   ( warning : major spoiler ahead .  enter at your own risk . )  of course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side .  this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup .  because qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi-wan , qui-gon's young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself .  so , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin " darth vader " skywalker .  did this story need to be told ?  i would say no .  but is it a worthwhile movie to see ?  absolutely .  if you don't enter the theater with jedi-size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie .  the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation .  the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight .  and yoda and young obi-wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time .  above all , this is a fun movie .  not deep , not meaningful , and not profound .  but fun .  maybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script , and the guy who directed " empire " will direct .  because if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential .   : )  
seen july 8 , 1998 at the crossgates cinema 18 , ( albany , ny ) , theater #7 , at 8 : 15 p . m . with my mom using hoyts cinema cash .  [theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats]  it's very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic , vivid sense of reality and life .  all stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters' lives , but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do .  therefore , " gone with the wind " deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does , in such a crafted , intricate , and entertaining manner .  it's a crowning achievement , not only in filmmaking , but for storytelling itself .  the film takes place in georgia before , during , and after the civil war .  this plays a major factor in the film's success .  to use such a historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy .  it might also seem cliche , boring and other such deterent factors to potential viewers .  can a story set so long ago be relatable now ?  the film confronts all these problems , paradoxically , by not cronfronting them .  it doesn't simply plug in the " right thing " at the " right time , " it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant .  building a strong foundation is important to all forms of media , without which , what is there to build on ?  we're given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters , especially our main character , scarlett o'hara ( leigh ) , a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel , a cunning wit , and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time .  she knows how her society works , wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her .  right from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be .  being the most sought-after woman allows her to manipulate men ( and their women ) to ensure she gets her way , whether it be obvious ( i . e .  who will be the one to get her food ) , or subtle ( i . e .  getting married just to spite someone ) .  the man she claims to love is ashley wilkes ( howard ) , a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him .  he isn't so arrogant and demanding as scarlett , in fact , he's engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his .  her name is melanie ( de havilland ) , and she is one of the sweetest , kindest , and most likable characters one will ever see .  she and scarlett become very dear friends , but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her , and the love she has for her husband .  her meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic - it defines who she is , but doesn't give her much emotional self-defense .  acting a catalyst to the love triangle , and to the story as a whole is the daper , stong-willed , cunning , cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler ( gable ) .  he's quite a character all right - everyone listens to what he has to say even though he's got a bad reputation .  butler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior .  he tells everyone the much-needed truth in the rigid caste-like society where freewill doesn't seem to exist , everything is done out of honor and tradition .  for example , in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there's no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out .  this angers them , not for his lack of faith , but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that .   " do we have ammunition factories ?  do we have food ?  do we have a navy ?  all we have is tobacco . "  all true statements and yet the south still insists he's wrong .  butler is a shifty character to be sure , but he takes such pride in his arrogance it's appealing .  scarlett notices this too when she first sees him , and from the look butler gives her , we know he's not going to stop until he has her .  but scarlett can't get past her need for ashley , and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story , butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever .  and so the story goes on , with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life .  the conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband , especially after she is " marked " for life when her first husband dies .  this gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story .  some are vital for only a few scenes , but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film .  in most films only a few characters exist for support in background , but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance .  even people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set .  the costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place .  the filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside , real world , but these types of simple approaches are never taken .  the first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war .  fleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is .  one scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming , " no !  not my leg !  don't cut off my leg ! "  another scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street , but as the camera pulls back , we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers , but it is their moaning that's more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be .  as the second half begins , the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single-handedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north .  she manages to resurrect the family plantation , but all the willpower she has can't help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south's ultimate defeat .  this brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love- hate relationship .  most of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship ( or lack thereof ) between rhett and scarlett .  each uses the other for personal gain , but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other .  scarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett can't help but want her more every time she tries to one-up him such as marrying another man and taking over his business .  they say opposites attract , but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities , it borders on magnetic polarization .  they need each other and know this , yet they never seem truly happy together .  perhaps they mistake love for passion , and the film leaves it up to us to make this call .  both have things the other wants and vice versa , but when they compromise , is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other .  love and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film , we're left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why .  gable and leigh do have great chemistry , always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture .  all ?  none ?  either way is possible and it's a mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings .  it's safe to say most of us won't live such overly dramatic lives as those in " gone with the wind , " but it's still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that we've just experienced a life's worth of joy and pain .  
oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with !  in a perfect world , " a civil action " would be a breath of fresh air .  it's cynical about lawyers in a way that grisham isn't .  it's romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham book/film isn't .  and , the capper , it has no distinct ending , and the law in hollywood films is that above all else , you must have an ending .  even if it's based on a true story , a true story which hasn't yet ended , you must supply an ending , a false one , but an ending nevertheless .  hell , " a civil action " is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together ( and that includes " the firm , " the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic ) .  yet it's also oddly and slightly unsatisfying .  weird .  this is , in fact , a steve zallian film , not just the work of a hack , and zallian is the director of the much-admired " search for bobby fischer " ( didn't see it ) and writer of none other than " schindler's list . "  in short , i like this guy , and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories .  after all , apart from the obvious it's-a-holocaust-film and it's-a-spielberg-film , isn't " schindler's list " just a damn brilliant film , not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study .   " a civil action " is the same way : it's narrative is split between being a lawyer film and being a character study .  and it's here that the film seems to go a bit wrong .  the main complaint of this film is that while , yes , it's an engrossing lawyerly tale , it has no real ending , and that's not necessarily the problem with the film .  it's that it's just kind of unsatisfying .  if this were a great film , it would feel complete , and still end basically the same way .  but this film just seems to end , and i don't want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on : imagine , if you will , being one of those the film is about , looking forward to this film , and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter , just so the many won't bitch about what is , essentially , genuine .  but the fact that it just ends is not , in all actuality , what is wrong with it .  it's rather that zallian has chosen , in the last half hour , to adandon the traditional lawyer story , and chose the other part of his story , the one about the lawyer , one jan schlictman ( john travolta ) , who's shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer , brilliant because he's manipulative and he always wins .  it wishes to make it all about jan in the end , but the truth is , his change , although nicely done , is not full .  we see him suffering from a personal crisis , and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart , but in the end , we don't fully believe it .  and i think that the problem is when he has made his decision , the film choses an odd angle to go at , a noble one , but one that gives the film's conclusion that of incompleteness .  in the opening of the film , we see him doing his old schtick , manipulating courts , winning cases effortlessly , and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases .  in short , he's full of bullshit and we know it .  in the film , he takes a case that is hardly desired : a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river .  point one , it's not of the usual criteria ( jan points out , wickedly , that dead or wounded children aren't nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success ) .  point two , it has been through several lawyers .  after turning them down , jan changes his mind ( a muddled scene - he stops his car on a bridge , looks out . . . is he feeling a sense of overachievement ? ) , and he and his team of lawyers ( tony shalhoub , zeljko ivanek , and accountant william h . macy ) head out to the town to do battle with the town's company .  they spend millions of dollars examining the land , test the water , what have you ( this is where stephen fry , a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in " wilde , " pops up thanklessly ) , and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children , and then , unsuccessfully , the workers at the plant .  they also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company , the eccentric jerome facher , played by robert duvall ( more on him later on ) .  as we progress , we get so involved in the way the story is being told , which is engulfing everything around it , including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople ( one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland , who lost her child , who begins to have a personal crisis ) .  things begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half , as they are up against impossible odds : the judge ( john lithgow ) is not only a strickler , but a pal of facher ; the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify ; no concrete evidence is being found , depsite the money spent to find it ; and they are quickly running out of money .  as macy mortgages everything he can , including their homes and their office , he slowly loses his sanity ( his meatiest role since , oh , " fargo " ) , and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist .  in fact , the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par ( owen gleiberman , especially , criticized the film for not being overly-dramatic . . . i  suppose like a grisham novel ) .  this wouldn't be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is : instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good , he's seen as being still full of bullshit .  because he doesn't take stock in the cares of his partners , and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town , he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out .  the final half tries to redeem this , as must have been the point of making this in zallian's mind , but what follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs , and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when he's seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes to employ him ( and thusly receiving two speeding tickets ) , we still feel that the big change in his life is that he's not rich and esteemed anymore ( the film's final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow ) .  the fault is not that there is no closure to the court case ( it's still going on , you know ) , but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has .  we need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life , and that the story is how a story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such a whopping change in his personal life .  it only feels like half of that .  maybe even less .  and it's not travolta , who does a great job here ( though never to be a truly memorable performance of his ) , but rather zallian , whose final chapter needs a rewrite .  up to then , though , it's an engrossing drama , one of the best of the year in fact , and one of the best lawyer films , period .  the reason is because it recognizes that a court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted , but rather it's about the lawyers , the knights who battle eachother .  we learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town , but the reason it can't be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find .  and duvall's facher is such a brilliant character and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man that it's almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is .  facher is seen as an elderly man , a goofy eccentric , carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it , eating lunches out of paper bags , and making a point to take time out of his day to listen to the radio , and scold anyone who interupts him .  but look deeper and you see a master at work : his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him , and it's difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way .  that's why i liked this film : it's hard to put a pointer on .  you can never see exactly where this film will land , and even when the credits roll , you still aren't sure what to make of it .  call it the zallian effect .  same thing happened with " schindler's list " ( not that i'm comparing oskar schindler to jan schlictman ) .  each film is so greatly crafted that you can't help but get involved in its broad storytelling , interesting characters , and , most peculiarly , the wit that comes along with it .  if only it felt totally complete ( like , say , " schindler's list , " though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between the two ) , it might have been one of the best films of the year , and along with that , a full breath of fresh air .  
expectation rating : a bit worse than expected ( mainly because i found the middle part to be a bit dull ) .  roger ebert gave it a four star review , and while he is a critic that uses the full scale , and i often agree -- such as dark city being the best film of 1998 , he must have seen a better film .  i read the book about five years ago and hugely enjoyed it .  the opening of a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter .  the landscape is snowy and cold , and is filmed what i feel is in a rather crisp manner ( which also reminds me of fargo ( which i loathed ) ) .  one can almost sense the cold .  but the movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick and the dead , instead raimi has made a more constrained film -- which probably is for the better .  this is probably not a movie that would have been improved by lots of odd shots .  the movie also reminded me of affliction , as the lead characters all seem to be hoping for and seeing a possibility to lead a better life than their father , and they see a chance for such a dream to come true .  this chance is uncovered in a snow covered field , where an airplane has crash landed .  in the plane three men find ? the american dream . . .  in a gym bag . ?  affliction too was set in a snowy landscape .  it really seems very simple .  just hold on to the money until spring , and if no one claims it , they'll be safe to spend it and their hope of experiencing the american dream can come true .  but the snow melts , and so might several of the character's hopes .  as in ? return to paradise ? , some of the characters are presented with a chance to do the right thing .  but doing the right thing might not result in a better result than something more selfish .  the movie's biggest strength is that it fact makes sense .  i have seen many movies based on books that just seem like selected scenes from the book visualized , eschewing anything remotely resembling a coherent story -- for example clear and present danger .  the biggest problem seems to over-familiarization with the story .  the writer perhaps feels that he doesn't have to present scenes that are clear to him , but the lack of which only baffles an audience which has not read the book .  this is definitely not the problem with a simple plan , even though the screenplay is by the book's author .  the movie is always clear on where it's going , and always makes sense .  i'm sue a lot was cut , but really i can't remember what .  even a minor scene involving a man complaining that he has paid for too much grains is included .  the man only comes in on mondays , but he claims that he has been charged for one purchase too many .  turns out . . .  well , see the movie .  one should be warned against seeing the trailer .  it reveals several scenes from the ending moments ( which yes , like in the book , it is a downer ) , several plot developments , and much of the beginning .  but much of this is not spelled directly out during the trailer , so if you're lucky , you'll have forgotten about all of this when you see the movie .  
full metal jacket , very much like every other hard-hitting film about the vietnam war , is an shocking , emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america .  this film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of a young man ( private joker , played by matthew modine ) during his tour in the vietnam war .  however , full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before : boot camp .  these sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film , even though i found the later portions to be equally stunning .  as in platoon , full metal jacket gets off to a quick start .  the opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits , which is getting their heads shaved .  from there , they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman , played extremely well by the former drill instructor r . lee ermey .  apparently , the solution was found for the perfect man to play a drill instructor in the movies , because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations .  private joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergeant , as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence ( vincent d'onofrio ) , whom is dubbed 'gomer pyle' by sgt .  hartman .  the film is continually narrated by private joker , in which he explains his visions on what is going on .  the entire corps , although repeatedly hammered by sgt .  hartman , continues on .  private pyle , however , seems to be the rag doll for the drill instructor .  he continually absorbs the worst punishment and humiliation , and it basically does not stop .  that is , until sgt .  hartman comes up with a new plan .  he will punish the rest of the soon-to-be-marines for pyle's goof-ups , even after joker was assigned to help him out in the best way he can .  pyle then receives punishment from his fellow recruits , and things take a turn for the worst .  pyle proves that not everyone is emotionally , physically , and mentally cut out for the life of a marine .  after graduation , joker is sent over to the height of the action in order to document the war , which is his service .  he is not a member of the infantry , and it is unclear if he will ever actually find himself in combat .  when he sets out on a documenting mission , this question becomes very clear from the start .  joker joins up with a platoon , along with his hometown friend cowboy ( arliss howard ) , and follows their everyday actions , interviewing and filmming them along the way .  he also soon finds himself in a position in which he must fight , or die .  again , as in the tradition of vietnam war films , full metal jacket can be debated as to whether it is an anti-war film or not .  a few of the more powerful scenes toward the end will leave you to decide .  full metal jacket succeeds extremely well in documenting the life of a young man in vietnam , as have others in the past .  this film , in different ways , also can be viewed as more powerful than others .  that , again , is up for debate and depends on your opinion .  one thing is for sure , however ; no one ever wants to experience the absolute hell that these soldiers are subjected to .  unfortunately , many did .  
what if one of our cities became the target for terror ?  what can we do ?  what can america really do about the increasing threat of terrorism ?  what basic human rights are we willing to sacrifice to prevent another oklahoma city disaster ?  so far america has been the leading nation , opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world .  it is the land of opportunities .  it is the land of freedom .  but what if it became the new target ?  this dark fantasy has unfortunately a very strong grounding in reality .  when a special branch of the united states military , under the command of general william devereaux ( bruce willis ) , takes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal , islamic fundamentalists across the world take notice .  the only warning the fbi receives is a single , cryptic message : " release him . "  then all hell breaks loose in new york .  a bus is destroyed , killing 25 civilians .  a broadway theater is bombed .  hostages are taken at a school .  as the wave of terrorist activity crests , the president must consider if the only way to save the city and break the grip of fear is to declare martial law .  devereaux argues against that eventuality , but is nevertheless ready to lead 10 , 000 men into action on american soil .  another person not in favor of martial law is anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities .  his staff is comprised of smart , energetic , intelligent men and women very much unlike the usual group o !  f moronic feds we're used to seeing in movies .  hubbard develops an uneasy alliance with cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , whose department knows more about the situation than they're willing to reveal .  but the attacks escalate .  the fbi are helpless , chasing an invisible enemy .  the land is under siege .  they have lost control . . a  terror is coming from within . .  what's great about this film is that it is made as if holding up a mirror to life .  it reflects reality .  and that's why it makes such an impact .  edward zwick has created a clever , well written and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season .  the director manages to tell several stories simultaneously .  and so his film plays on several levels , never loosing focus on its main objective .  he is exploring the abuse of power , the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the u . s . government ( the army , the fbi , and the cia ) .  he takes a look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets and lies are involved .  the palestinian community in 1998 new york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii .  there are concentration camps and unlawful interments , all in the name of the " greater good . "  in the latter part of the film the land of opportunities looses its heart and soul -- freedom .  was that what the terror !  ists really wanted ?  this film has evoked protests and objections from the arab-american population in the u . s . and n . y . especially .  but to me these protests seem unnecessary .  zwick is careful to not step over the line and make the palestinians typical hollywood bad guys .  the script is therefore wonderfully balanced .  agent hubbard's best friend and loyal colleague frank haddad ( tony shalhoub ) is lebanese-american .  and it is quite often you hear lines such as " my first boyfriend was palestinian .  they seduce you with their suffering " or " they love this country as much as we do . "  but no matter how you twist this matter , you won't get away from the fact that when it comes to world wide terrorism it is arab-speaking population who are in the great majority .  more to the point , the siege demonstrates the injustice of blanket condemnation of any ethnic group by depicting the unfair treatment of all arab-americans by the u . s . military .  and thus this film does not serve as a source for discrimination in any !  way .  denzel washington is dashing as always .  in this role he is much more determined and stronger than usual .  anette bening is enjoyable and believable as a shadowy cia operative who prefers espionage , a network of snitches and seduction to gather information . .  bruce willis is terrifying as the sadist , hungry for power , that never looses his connection with the audience , since his point of view is not too hard to understand .  the film is elegantly shaped .  the scenes are easily floating into each other and the film never seems overlong .  zwick knows exactly how to provoke tension , horror and emotions and does it with a rarely observed professionalism .  he tightens the intensity as the events progress .  and when a plot twist comes , it actually is surprising .  it is not a film drained in patriotism , like the work of roland emerich .  nor is it a film that portrays explosions purely for entertainment values .  it is a daring picture that has courage enough to undertake such a risky story and difficult journey .  it has courage enough to get involved in politics .  it questions our foreign policies , mentality and defense .  i must admit that it ends rather disappointing , as the director turns the patriotism way up and innovation down .  but despite of that , it is certainly an intelligent and thrilling film that provokes emotions and thoughts ; a virtue that few summer films can boast of .   " this is the u . s . army .  it's a broadsword , not a scalpel .  believe me , you do not want us in an american city " - gen . william devereaux , " the siege "  
available in an all new video edition from arrow entertainment ( $29 . 95 ) , with an introduction by david carradine , written & produced by wayne j . keeley  f . w . murnau's career ended sadly and prematurely .  the german director of such classics as " sunrise " and " the last laugh " died in a car accident shortly after signing a deal to make american pictures at paramount .  murnau was reportedly a giant man , well over six feet , a towering figure probably incapable of anything but a grand entrance .  which brings us to " nosferatu : a symphony of horror " : surely he felt a kinship with his title character , the looming vampire embodied by intimidating max schreck ; in one of the most indelible images in film history , silent or otherwise , schreck rises from his grave , gnarled hands outstretched , and he's so big that part of his head is cropped by the top of the frame .  the plot of " nosferatu . . . "  is lifted--unauthorized--from bram stoker's " dracula " .  the british hutter is an eager real estate man assigned to visit and discuss future living arrangements with count orlock of transylvania .  he leaves behind girlfriend emily , only to discover orlock's secret--he's a bloodsucker--and struggle to return to england before the nosferatu reaches his lady love .  in addition to schreck's performance , the cinematography and effects are outstanding .  arrow video's digitally remastered version of the classic is something of a mixed-coffin .  the cover art features a red-tinted , hairy , goateed vampire staring straight at you , his fanged mouth agape , while the bodies of two sexy , writhing women entice you below .  trouble is , murnau's monster is pale-faced , bald , pointy-eared , and non-goateed , and there isn't a single sexy , writhing woman to be found in his movie .  this sort of misleading packaging makes little sense when one recalls the countless number of ghouslish scenes in the film from which cool cover art could have been extracted .  additionally , notifying the viewer that this is in fact murnau's film seems like afterthought since his name and the genuine title are written in small print below our goateed vampire .  that said , a good mastering job has been performed on the film itself .  the original elements are not in the best condition--non-studio silents were unlucky in their preservation-- so we're still dealing with a slightly washed out , scratched , jittering image .  but at least the day and night scenes are tinted sepia and blue , respectively , especially helpful to an audience who may question nosferatu's waltzing around during what seems like sunlight ( it took a lot of light to expose stock in the twenties ) .  the title cards have been redone , and they are legible , accurate , and digitally altered to flicker--a very nice touch .   ( even the opening copyright warning flickers ! )  the score has been replaced by music from type o negative , a hard-rock group , arguably gothic , and their songs underscore the film nicely-- certainly the coolest video a band can ask for .  when our hero , hutter , first steps onto the doomed carriage to count orlock's castle , we hear a well-timed " now you're dead ! "  from lead singer peter steele .  david carradine makes an appropriately vampiric host ; he fiddles with a blade and cane while introducing the film .  after the feature , which runs about 63 minutes , is included a new music video from type o negative , the black-and-white fang-fest " black no . 1 " .  of course , " nosferatu : a symphony of horror " is the main attraction , and while my latest viewing raised questions ( why is the woman called emily in the title cards but " mina " --as bram stoker called her--in hutter's letters ? , for instance ) , it made me realize how much this movie has inspired and been stolen from .  coppola's 1992 " bram stoker's dracula " owes a great stylistic debt to murnau's masterpiece , but the one thing it couldn't thieve was the original's abstract charms .  this latest incarnation from arrow will probably- -like the rescored " metropolis " a few years back--turn a silent film into more palpable entertainment for the latest generation of film freaks .  
it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system .  no major surprise , when j . s . mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make up his mind over liberal democracy either .  the americans are wrought by the archetypal paradox under which they exist , the supreme contradiction between the right of the one and the right of the majority .  small wonder that hollywood's most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individual-underdog against some larger collective oppressive - witness braveheart , born on the fourth of july , rocky , first blood , clear and present danger , jfk , the list goes on .  there's little of that in singapore - we are barred access to playboy and penthouse both on and off line , though the government's been long worried about the younger people getting " americanised " and advocating individual rights and parliamentary opposition .  the people vs . larry flynt locates the political debate within the greatest social taboo in america - sex .  does pornography have a right to exist and circulate ?  larry flynt , the publisher of hustler magazine , thinks so , and obviously so too the u . s . congress which last month threw out a bill to curb pornography on the net .  but even with such actions , americans remain undecided .  the oscars apparently shunned the movie because it was an embarrassing and sensitive livewire .  what they have ignored is actually a great picture .  woody harrelson as the lead character reprises his role as a to-hell-with-morality , to-hell-with-the-law , and to-hell-with-the-system anti-christ that we last saw in natural born killers .  and he is outrageous and convincing as a nihilistic atheist who nonetheless loves his ex-stripper wife dearly .  the latter is played with abandon , conviction and sensitivity all at once by courtney love , who is the real star of the show and really snubbed of an academy award best actress nomination , if not of the award itself .  edward norton plays their jerky lawyer .  the relationship between harrelson and love brings out another great paradox - superficially they are immoral outcasts who've had it coming ; woody gets shot and becomes paralysed from the waist down , and courtney dies of aids .  god's damnation .  but in the powerful love they have for each other , each standing by the other in turn , the two leads highlight the question how much is the nihilist still a moralist and ( in the american context ) a christian , if they can love and care , and feel just like anyone else on a personal level .  friedrich nietzsche once talked about how the atheist must uncover for himself the full consequences of atheism by ridding himself of all moral-christian influences .  to go beyond good and evil .  this is a great picture , no doubt , and i love it personally .  because it is moving , funny , ends with open american optimism blah blah .  but i like it and admire it because it comes from a fine american tradition that dares to raise difficult questions , and call into doubt ideas and doctrines that otherwise are used as catchphrases .  there are times when movies go beyond the story they tell and reflect something of hidden realities .  this movie is not so much about larry flynt , but about americans and american society .  
as a revolutionary war hero in the patriot , mel gibson provides another macho man performance for hollywood audiences .  you know the type : his shirt is always shredded , his face always scarred , he has a soft spot for his loved ones and a " to kill " list for his enemies .  oscar-hungry director/executive producer roland emmerich did not intend to , but he made the stereotypical action hero for the 18th century .  as gibson delivers lines like , " before this war is over , i am going to kill you , " schwarzenegger in commando or stallone in cobra immediately come to mind .  oddly enough , the patriot is as much an epic three-hour-tear-fest like gladiator , as it is a ninety-minute guilty pleasure .  at times absorbing , at others enjoyably insipid , this is good , bloody summer fun .  i probably would have despised this film had it not been released over the july 4th weekend .  some of the images are so zealously americanized ( the flag is used as a lifesaving weapon for example ) , that independence day seems the only appropriate time of year to wholeheartedly accept it .  like emmerich's id4 , this is obvious propaganda where the americans are the hapless underdogs motivated by freedom for all .  sure it's predictable and melodramatic , but for a moment after leaving the theater , i was dumbfounded with patriotism .  and isn't that the point of the patriot ?  gibson plays benjamin martin , the lionized french and indian war veteran , who , at the beginning of the film , is emotionally suffering after his loving wife passed away .  he is left to father seven children at his south carolina estate along with black servants ( not slaves ! ) .  as the revolutionary war rumbles miles away , martin swears to keep his family close and away from the battlefields .  but when the oldest son enlists anyway and another is murdered by a wicked redcoat colonel ( jason isaacs ) , martin quickly decides to save the day ( or save the fate of america as presented by emmerich ) .  forming a band of aggressive farmers and using guerilla tactics considered unfair in the art of war , martin becomes the number one target of the british army .  the best parts of the patriot are the scenes in which martin and his rugged militia men outsmart the british armies left and right .  every time the farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy , to see the disbelief on british general cornwallis' ( tom wilkinson ) face was priceless entertainment .  and as the tension gradually formulates with the running time , a final battle is inevitable .  as for the numerous battle scenes , they are expertly done .  clearer and more realistic than those of gladiator , the gruesome images are what give this film an r rating .  you really get a sense of how warfare was performed during that time period .  everything is performed in an orderly ( but still quite gory ) fashion - one side shoots , then the other side , then the remaining soldiers charge .  it's organized , strategic and , according to martin , ineffective .  there is a very interesting contrast between the traditional battle style and martin's take-no-prisoners method .  what drives martin to these supposedly unfair actions , are the originally brutal tactics of colonel tavington .  played wonderfully by jason isaacs , tavington is the type who loves to glare down from his horse at civilians , who nervously avoid eye contact .  this character is viciously evil ; he kills women and children and then laughs about it on the way home ; even his eyes are evil .  his portrayal has sparked some controversy in britain , some claim that he falsely represents his countrymen as " cowardly " and " sadistic . "  i disagree with this accusation .  tavington does not represent his country ; his unnecessary executions shock his own colleagues and even anger his general .  besides tavington , the redcoats remain stick figures that are neither glorified nor patronized .  and stick figures make the easiest enemies in these kinds of movies - why give the audience a reason to love the bad guys ?  heck , why not spend the entire film glossing up the good guys ?  the patriot is three hours of fictional fireworks .  with an action hero seeking revenge and a comic book villain ready to take him down , it's a lethal weapon for the colonial times .  god bless america !  and god bless the patriot !  
ok , i admit i had a bad attitude about this film from the start .  a romantic comedy about the trials and tribulations of single working parents ?  with a couple of incredibly cute kids thrown in for good measure ?  yuck .  but it's not really too bad .  it has a lot working against it , for me at least .  in addition to the above , it is typical of a lot of recent movies in that it is really just a glorified made-for-tv movie , but longer and with bigger stars , and you have to pay to see it .  it does win you over , though , even if it is painfully predictable .  just think about it : two single parents , with their cute kids , are thrown together due to a missed field trip .  through a day of near disasters , they cont inually meet , get in one another's way , cause trouble for one another , and generally insult one another at every opportunity .  in fact , they hate each other so much that we know that they are , or soon will be , in love .  the only people who hate each other more than lovers are married couples .  so this film is predictable , just as the screwball comedies of the classical hollywood cinema were predictable ( and the screwball genre is obviously hoffman's model for this film ) .  will they get fired from their yuppie jobs ?  will they make the big soccer game that is so important to their kids ?  will pfeiffer realize what a jerk her ex-husband , a drummer for bruce springsteen , really is ( aren't they all ? ) ?  will they finally kiss ?  well , what do you expect ?  but there is a certain amount of satisfaction in having our expectations fulfilled , especially when it is done with as much humour , along with a lack of sticky sentimentality , as it is in this film .  pfeiffer and clooney have a certain chemistry together that is surprisingly charming , and the kids are neither shoved into the background nor allowed to steal the show .  one word of caution , though .  this film is being billed in some places as a " family " movie .  don't let that stop you .  however , i think most kids , especially boys , would be pretty bored by this move .  after all , nobody gets killed and there are no explosions .  all in all , a good , non-offensive date movie .  the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .  
is evil dead ii a bad movie ?  it's full of terrible acting , pointless violence , and plot holes yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release .  explaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots ( including the original evil dead ) is extremely difficult .  `well what's it about ? '  `five people stranded in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly , hairy , wart covered monsters . '  `come on i saw a movie just like that on monster vision last week .  why should i see it again ? '  `no evil dead ii is different , it's funny . '  `it's funny to see people die ?  are you sick or something ? '  maybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie .  his unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle , as disturbing as it is hilarious .  an example of raimi's odd approach : a monster ( formerly protagonist ash's girlfriend of all people ) is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound .  sure it's over-the-top , but it is so over-the-top that it is laugh out loud funny ; just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood , staining his face and knocking him back a few feet .  the whole movie is like this , watch ash get beat up , watch ash defeat the monster , watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster .  the more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets , the more amusing it becomes .  no matter how sick it may sound , it is funny to watch bruce ampbell's ash get his butt kicked every five minutes .  and raimi takes advantage , he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend , by the body of an old lady , even by his own right hand .  like the less superior idle hands , we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over and over again until he is forced to cut off his own body part .  but it doesn't end , ash now has to fight his severed hand which now moves with the same celerity as thing from the addams family .  all of these events , thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster- like camera movements , at first become shocking , then inexplicably funny .  raimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses , he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers' duck soup , then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off .  with a running time of less than an hour and a half , raimi gets away with the impossible , making a horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares .  ending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series , raimi obviously had a lot of fun making this movie and couldn't wait to make it's sequel .  
the film " magnolia " can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests .  the dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower .  they all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart .  the numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially .  from a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host , each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain .  they are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness .  whether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse , each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one .   " magnolia " is a clever , well thought out film from prodigy director-writer paul thomas anderson of " boogie nights " fame .  the detailed character analyses and the powerful script make " magnolia " memorable .  however , what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories , the film is never confusing .  anderson's control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful .  he also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of " magnolia's " scenes drag on too long .  any three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending .  from the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn't get boring .  it is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot .  this is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation .  every character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees .  for example , cop john c . reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through hall's daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly .  the fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes , races , and genders suffer .  anderson's explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing .  the only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously .  this was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get .  the performances in " magnolia " are perfection .  this is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting .  anderson allows many of hollywood's best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best , character acting .  all of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film .  worth noting is tom cruise , who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny but depressing tour de force performance .  he was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past ( however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints ) the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon's character as phillip baker hall's wife .  she seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not seen her enough earlier in the film .   " magnolia " uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters .  anderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few hours .  to see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of diversity .  diversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of time .  i predict a lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future .  
with stars like sigourney weaver ( " alien " trilogy ) and academy award winner holly hunter ( the piano , raising arizona , etc . ) together in a single hollywood production , one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot .  sadly for copycat , though tightly scripted and nicely plot , is still at heart , a typical hollywood thriller .  helen ( weaver ) , after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer , darryl ( harry connick jr . ) , has developed a phobia for being outdoors , so to speak .  incidentally , helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers , which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes .  a year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco .  detective monahan ( hunter ) and getz ( mulroney ) , baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer , seeks the professional help of helen , who , as expected was reluctant at first .  copycat " borrows " a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases , it did work .  but copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability , this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also . . .  much of the time wasted could've been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama .  even so , weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments . . .  weaver being the vulnerable yet strong-within character ( as in aliens ) and hunter being the short , tough , texan speaking cop ( as in raising arizona ) .  harry connick jr . , a very good jazz singer , shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter .  which comes to the moment of judgement ( drum roll please . . . ) .  copycat is a good thriller .  although the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show , copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats , in anticipation of the killers next immediate move .  this worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts .  nice movie to bring your girlfriend to . . . .  
every year--every year at the festival , i wait for that film to come along , that one that just pulls me out of my seat , sticks its face up next to my nose , and roars " sur-prise ! "  into my bewildered visage .  it's almost always a surprise .  it sure as niflheim was this time .  amazing grace and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale , of a boy in montana who quits his little league team for a very unusual reason .  and , in the hands of anyone less careful than the creative staff of this film , it might very well be nothing more than a fairy tale , where we roll our eyes occasionally , smirk to ourselves , and maybe get a forced tear out of the eyes and a " boy , i wish that could happen " sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater and tossing the empty pepsi cup into the trash .  another e . t .  another short circuit .  this film floored me , for the simple reason that while it has a fairy tale concept , the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough , and presents itself well enough , to make it more of an american folk tale , with characters who are both icons and real people at the same time .  america has always had its mythical heros , its paul bunyans and john waynes ; this film presents us with more general , but still universal , ideals : the honest , innocent children who have their own inner wisdom ; the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage , honor , and love for their respective sport ; the venerable elected official who leads with kindness and understanding , but has the grit to get things done when they need doin' ( does the latter sound familiar ? ) .  amazing grace and chuck is a showcase for these characters , but it never leaves you with the feeling that it's artificial , that it stands behind glass , or that any sharp breeze--or , more importantly , sharp thought--will shatter the wax facade of the panorama .  this is a very sturdy scenario .  the principals are always given dialogue , and always give performances--always ( it just blows me away ) -- which made them seem real , yet enforces their particular mythic role .  the writer/producer , david field , seems to literally take all the " yeah , but in real life , this would have happen " thoughts you get in your head , sticks them in the movie and uses them to bend the plot around to his original heading , in a stronger way then before !  astounding !  he uses obstacles to the plot to * enforce * it !  i am truly impressed ( indeed , envious ) with the skill in which he wrote the story and screenplay ; it's so very unusual , especially in a hollywood film .  i don't want to give too much away , but the basic premise is that chuck ( joshua zuehlke ) , the little league pitcher , decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons .  his decision begins an unlikely series of events that involve another athlete , a boston basketball player ( alex english ) , " amazing " grace smith , and , well , i'm leaving it at that because i wouldn't spoil this film for you for the world .  let me just say this , though : i am not recommending this film because i think it has a great message or because of any political positions it might imply .  i don't give a rat's ass for the political point-of-view this film expresses , one way or another ; i'm recommending you go see this film because , and only because , it's an excellent story , told with excellence .  no , i don't believe what happens in this film could happen in real life ; while i tend to believe the arms control policy of this country is stilted , i believe in careful negotiations , mutual verification , etc . screw what i think .  the point is , this film is able to suspend my disbelief and tell a story that is one of the most finely crafted pieces of american dream i have ever seen on the movie screen .  this is the natural and more--all the mythic qualities without the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of the conclusion , and a much better script to boot .  it carried me into the beliefs and ideals of my boyhood--and , more importantly , without any bumps or jolts that would snap me out of the trance with some hint of self-consciousness .  special kudos to : both zuehlke ( a real-life little league pitcher who was picked for the part ) and english ( a forward for the denver nuggets ) for their seamless personification of their characters ; jamie lee curtis , who takes a surprisingly small role and makes it exceedingly memorable as amazing's manager and friend ; william l . peterson ( in a * big * change from his role in to live and die in l . a . ) as a father who shows principles without having to stand up and wave a flag doing it ; and gregory peck , as the guy we wish ronald reagan really was ( and who some numbskulls still probably think he is  
fritz lang's first american film since leaving nazi germany , is an eye-opener about a lynch mob in a small town .  joe wilson ( spencer tracy ) is a regular joe , a hard-working stiff , a decent guy , who is living with his two brothers , tom ( walcott ) and charlie ( albertson ) , in chicago .  he is engaged to katherine grant ( sylvia sidney ) , but can't save up enough money to marry her .  she takes the train west for a better paying job as a teacher .  before she departs , she gives him the wedding ring her father gave to her mother , sews up his ripped trench coat , corrects him when he mistakingly says the wrong word for memento , and kisses him goodbye .  a year goes by and joe buys a car and tells katherine that he will meet her to get married in capitol city , that he has quit his job and hopes to open a gas station .  driving through the rural backroads and camping out at night while going to met her , he arrives at a near-by town called strand .  but the deputy sheriff " buggs " meyers ( walter brennan ) comes upon him waving a shotgun and arrests him .  he accuses him of the kidnapping of a little girl .  the sheriff ( ellis ) finds salted peanuts on him just like the kidnapper had in his pocket , he also has a five dollar bill on him that matches one of the numbers of the ransom money , and he fits the general description of the suspect .  locked in jail , he waits for the district attorney to look at his claim of innocence .  in the local bar , the town citizens go into a rage when learning that an arrest has been made in the kidnapping .  fueled by angry talk about getting back at the kidnapper and of having the deputy inadvertently telling them of the ransom money found on the suspect , a mob storms the jail , burns it down and dynamites it when they can't get through to the prisoner's jail cell .  the sheriff called the governor for the national guard , but one of his political advisers countermanded that request , saying it wouldn't look right for the governor in an election year to call out troops for those he wants to vote for him .  somehow joe escapes , but his dog rainbow dies .  katherine hears what has happened on the radio and rushes to the neighboring town of strand only to see him engulfed by flames in his cell , and becomes convinced that he died .  the next day the newspapers announce that the guilty kidnapper confesses .  joe makes his way back to chicago and tells his brothers , who are startled to see him alive , that he wants revenge .  he thereby supplies his brothers with the names of the 22 leaders in the lynch mob .  an ambitious district attorney ( walter abel ) prosecutes the 22 for murder .  katherine , not knowing he's alive , remains in a state of shock , but is asked to be a witness that she saw joe burning to death .  the defense claims that it can't be a charge of murder without a corpse .  the trial proves to be interesting , as the citizens in this close-knit , respectable community , lie under oath , providing alibis for each other to prove they couldn't have been at the jail .  the sheriff also lies , saying he can't identify anyone in the mob .  but proof comes by way of a newsreel cameraman who caught the whole incident on film .  as for proof of the corpse , an anonymous letter is addressed to the judge enclosed with the wedding ring katherine gave joe .  in the note , memento is misspelled , which makes katherine realize that joe is alive .  when the sentence is announced , 20 of the accused are found guilty of murder , but joe marches into the courtroom and gives a pious speech about what happened .  katherine forgives him , and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have .  but don't blame lang for all the changes in the film , of trying to take the town off the hook by introducing this wild revenge motive .  mgm couldn't bear to have it made the way lang wanted it , that is , by having tracy die in the lynching .  instead they wanted to stop short of condemning so many small american towns where lynchings actually do occur , and they thereby meddled throughout the entire script .  to lang's credit , even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference , it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook .  his portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised .  you couldn't help get the feeling that the citizens didn't care that much that they almost lynched an innocent man , but cared more about protecting the reputation of their town and would do anything to keep their 22 vigilantes from going to jail , even perjuring themselves .  their reaction to seeing joe alive was satisfying only in that it meant they weren't going to be convicted .  lang by no means implies that the town has learned its lesson from this incident .  he does imply that a dark side to joe wilson has been exposed , and the innocent , jovial good-guy , seen in the beginning of the film , has been largely altered forever by this traumatic experience .  
i didn't realize how apt the name of this movie was until i called the mpaa ( the motion picture association of america - the folks who decide what's g , nc 17 , pg , r or x ) to ask why the preview was rated r . so that we can make some sense of their response , let me tell you about the movie itself .   " the celluloid closet " is a documentary about how homosexuality has been portrayed in the movies over the past several decades .  it's brilliant , funny , naughty and extremely poignant .  it tore at my heart to watch a gifted lesbian screenwriter explain that , as a rule , gay audiences hunger for any hint of homosexuality on screen .  regardless of how veiled - or how sordid - the presence of a gay or lesbian person allows others to lessen their sense of isolation and makes them feel as if they're not quite so invisible as america seems to want them to be .  the movie itself is rated r - and for good reason .  it contains scenes of bloody , violent gay bashing and graphic , uninhibited , sex .  as with any movie , i appreciate knowing about these things ahead of time , so i can decide for myself whether to see the movie with a friend , a date , my 11 year old niece , alone or not at all .  but , that's the movie .  now back to the preview .  prior to this film being theatrically released ( it was originally filmed as a documentary for hbo ) i had seen the coming attractions trailer for it at least six times .  there was no nudity , no violence , no bad language , nothing that i could see that would be offensive or inappropriate for a general audience ( okay , whoopi goldberg did refer to someone " boning " someone , but the last i knew that wasn't one of the seven words you can't say on tv ) .  except for a scene of two fully clothed men kissing .  hmmmmm .  when i inquired about the rating on the trailer , a very nice woman at the mpaa quoted from " the handbook " that a trailer approved for all audiences could contain " no homosexuality or lesbianism and no going down on someone . "  hello ? i was in the office and it was the middle of the day .  bravely , i pursued .   " i've seen that trailer , oh . . .  probably half a dozen times , " i gulped . . .   " and i don't remember that scene . "   " well , " she chirped .   " it's there .  our little eyes are trained to see that . "  no really .  in the words of dave barry , " i am not making this up . "  they are " trained " to " see that ? "  when someone who was shocked at the rating the first time and made a note to watch it carefully the following five times or so managed to let it slip past her ?  gosh , i certainly don't mean to question the mpaa , or " the handbook " .  i would , however , like to suggest that it's they who are in the closet on this one .  and the light ain't good in there .  but , having seen " the celluloid closet , " and being one of a handful of straight people involved in a primarily gay and lesbian weekly bible study ( email me and i'll give you the details ) , none of this was any big surprise .  the point of the movie was that homosexuality , even in the politically correct 90s , is ridiculously perceived as a threat to a mostly heterosexual society .  a point well made in this candid and honest film .  now , i could go off on the mpaa's ruling that a trailer must contain " no homosexuality or lesbianism " and ask how that is defined , particularly in light of some of the things , both sexual and non-sexual , that i've watched straight people do in trailers .  i just don't feel the need to go there , because it seems so obvious .  i'll instead suggest that the mpaa re-evaluated their evaluation criteria .  let the ratings reflect not subject content , like " sex " and " violence " .  let them reflect attitude content .  in the future , i'd be interested in knowing whether the movie is rated d for disrespectful or s for stereotyped .  then i'd truly be able to make an informed decision about how i spent my time .  
a couple of months ago , when i first downloaded the face/off trailer from the net , my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold 'yawn' .  followed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key , not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this piss-poor trailer .  then i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u . s . . . . . unique . . . excellent . . . . must-see .  well , i thought still skeptical , i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here .  'here' , of course , was still three months away .  i'll admit , when i trotted off to see this film , the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow .  i'd heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled , but his films were definitely not on my must-see list .  that , let me tell you , has changed completely .  i knew this fact only five minutes into the film , after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet .  the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick .  seriously .  i've never been a big john travolta fan , but he , like cage , perfectly suited his role in the movie . . . . . sorry ,  make that 'roles' in the movie .  even travolta's great performance , however , paled in comparison to cage's character portrayals .  my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hassler's hideout .  half drugged out of his mind , he sits there reclining back in a chair talking about his son's death from castor's perspective - " doesn't it just break your heart . " he mutters coldly .  now don't go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie - it's not .  that's what really makes this movie unique .  it's an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters . . . . . not a common mix at all .  suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though . . . . . that's  the only way to overlook the fact that travolta and cage fire around 5671 rounds at each other . . . . and  never hit .  several action scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press 'rewind' and watch it over again .  the part where archer and troy have a stand off on either side of a double-sided mirror is just plain brilliant .  whilst cage's and travolta's performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies , the lesser characters are just as intriguing .  joan allen , who usually sticks to the straight drama movies , plays her part perfectly as archer's long suffering wife .  i like the fact that her character didn't end up toting a gun at the end of the movie . . . it  would have wrecked her potrayal .  gina gershon was surprising to say the least as castor troy's mistreated girlfriend . . . . . make that * one of * castor troy's mistreated girlfriends .  other movies would have used her character as just window dressing . . . a  sex object , but instead her character is very strong and independent .  dominique swain , who plays archer's daughter , also does a nice job , though her character is not as explored as much as allen's or gershon's .  faults ? well . . . there were some i have to say .  first , the movie's ending , whilst being very good overall , was a bit too drawn out for it's own good .  after the two combatants begin duelling again after the final boat crash you can't help but think - " geez , are you guys nuclear powered or what ? " .  there were certain bits that weren't handled properly , like where archer appears safe and sound on solid ground after jumping off the converted oil platform/prison - more explanation here would have been nice .  overall , this movie was not perfect .  but i thought it was about as close as an action movie has ever came to perfect .  many critics have claimed that this movie will change the way action movies are made . . . . . i  certainly hope so .  
anyone who saw alan rickman's finely-realized performances in truly madly deeply and sense and sensibility will be unsurprised that the actor-turned-director is a bit of a poet at heart .  however , for those who recall him only as the maniacal villain of die hard and robin hood : prince of thieves , this recognition may be something of a shock .  nevertheless , " poetic " is an excellent term to describe rickman's feature debut as a director , the winter guest .  the film has a simple , unhurried rhythm that uses all of the available elements to fashion a successful whole .  the result is an occasionally haunting , sometimes magical , and always insightful human drama .  the winter guest isn't about resolving plot threads and advancing a story line ; it's about exploring relationships and examining life in all of its stages .  the winter guest does not tell a traditional tale , nor does it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure ? there is no real beginning or end .  instead , we are given an opportunity to observe one day in the lives of eight humans .  they represent both sexes , multiple generations , and a variety of relationships ? male and female ; young , middle-aged , and elderly ; friends , would-be lovers , and kin .  we see expectations fulfilled and disappointed , emotional boundaries eroded , and truths unveiled .  there is comedy and tragedy .  most importantly , much of what transpires during the course of the winter guest will find an echo in our own lives ? in this fiction can be found much truth .  the setting is small town in scotland on the coldest day of the year .  it's so frigid that the sea has begun to freeze over .  the onshore wind cuts like a knife and snow blankets the beach , giving the terrain an alien appearance .  it is against this backdrop that the relationships of the film are captured .  there are four pairings , and , although there is some interaction between the different twosomes , the winter guest's focus is on the dynamics internal to each relationship .  the first , meatiest pairing is that of elspeth ( phylida law ) and her recently-widowed daughter , frances ( emma thompson ) .  these two have a stormy relationship .  they love each other deeply , but both are stubborn and willful , and neither is willing to admit that they need the other .  much of their interaction is argumentative , but , during the course of a long walk to the frozen shoreline , they come to an unspoken understanding of how much each means to the other .  frances' adult son , alex ( gary hollywood ) , is a lonely young man who has been caring for his mother since the death of his father .  on this day , he meets a girl , nita ( arlene cockburn ) , who has secretly been spying on him for weeks .  although their first encounter is antagonistic ( she throws a snowball at him ) , both quickly become aware of an undeniable attraction .  once they retire to a place where they can be alone , however , things don't go exactly as planned .  lily ( sheila reid ) and chloe ( sandra voe ) are a couple of old friends who are frequent funeral attendees .  death is a topic of endless fascination for them , perhaps because they are so close to it , and they spend their spare time scanning the obituaries , looking for the next funeral or cremation in the area .  it doesn't matter whether or not they knew the deceased .  it's the ceremony that they're interested in .  sam ( douglas murphy ) and tom ( sean biggerstaff ) , a pair of schoolboy chums , are spending this cold february day cutting classes and hanging out at the beach , horsing around , building a small fire for warmth , and walking on the frozen water .  unlike lily and chloe , these two have their entire lives ahead of them .  they are young enough to still believe in magic , but old enough to recognize that the process of crossing into adulthood robs life of the simple joy that only children can experience .  the acting is strong and believable .  the mixture of veteran performers and first-timers is effective , with the most successful choice being the casting of real-life mother and daughter phylida law and emma thompson in the most prominent roles .  there is a chemistry in their interaction that would be hard to replicate with two different , non-related actors .  and , of course , the physical resemblance makes it that much easier to accept elspeth and frances as parent and child .  the winter guest began its life as a stage play in 1995 , with rickman as the director .  four of the film's principals , phylida law , arlene cockburn , sheila reid , and sandra voe , appeared in the theatrical version before moving to the film .  unlike several recent motion pictures adapted from plays , the winter guest has been successfully opened up .  the rough , bleak scottish countryside becomes as much of a character as any of the eight humans .  in fact , considering how important the climate is to every relationship under rickman's microscope , it could be argued that this is the single most important element of the movie .  if you appreciate character studies , the winter guest is a solid effort with enough power to stay with you after you have left the theater .  
as feel-good formulaic as it may be in its own way , shall we dance ?  also demonstrates a kind of charming restraint you don't often find in american films .  this japanese import tells the story of a middle-aged accountant named sugiyama ( koji yakusho ) whose mundane life is shaken up one night when he spots beautiful mai kishikawa ( tamiyo kusakari ) in the window of a dance school .  intrigued by her melancholy demeanor ( and slightly infatuated with her ) , sugiyama signs up for weekly classes at the school -- and , much to his amazement , ends up as attracted to dancing itself as to his young sensei .  meanwhile , sugiyama's wife ( hideko hara ) becomes suspicious of his late wednesday nights , and sets a private detective on her husband's trail .  in a hollywood film , you can bet that sub-plot would be turned into a stream of slapstick comedy and crazy misunderstandings .  in shall we dance ? , writer/director masayuki suo dispenses with it in a matter of minutes , using it to set up later character interactions rather than letting it overwhelm the story with pratfalls .  neither does he make the climactic moment of victory a competition between the hero and some mean-spirited token rival .  suo gives his comedy the graceful movements of his subject matter , allowing the humor to flow from the characters rather than forcing it upon them .  an opening prologue in shall we dance ?  goes to some effort to place the film in a sociological perspective , explaining how contrary ballroom dancing is to the japanese sense of propriety .  it's a forced message in a story which doesn't need such a culture-specific angle .  the dance school in shall we dance ?  plays the role of a singles' mixer , with everyone vaguely embarrassed to be there yet taking the opportunity to try on new personalities .  most amusing among these new personalities is the one adopted by sugiyama's co-worker mr . aoki ( naoto takenaka ) , a balding systems analyst who becomes a fiery latin lover when he dons a frizzy wig and begins to rumba .  sugiyama's awakening is less overt , but koji yakusho does a wonderful job showing a transformation of small steps .  it's a delicate performance with a huge heart .  shall we dance ?  is a fairly lightweight experience , which makes its final half hour rather a long sit .  suo crams a lot of exposition into very little time , including an unnecessarily detailed back-story for mai , resulting in a sluggish march towards the resolution .  it is here that shall we dance ?  feels most hollywood-conventional , attempting to blind-side the audience with a truckload of emotional catharsis .  suo might have been better advised to conclude with the small gem of a scene in which sugiyama and his wife take their first tentative dance steps together .  that's the real joy of dance shall we dance ?  conveys : its ability to create an intoxicating mood of romance which can soften the stiffest shirt .  
written by mark rosenthal and lawrence konner  starring charlize theron , bill paxton , david paymer  as reviewed by james brundage  i'm beginning to get fed up .  over my four years as a critic , the thing which has kept me going is the moderate balance of films .  the good balances the bad .  i try to see both in equal proportions .  but disney's mighty joe young remake marks the fourth week in which i haven't seen a truly terrible movie .  it's a backwards machismo , i suppose , the urge to see the things which you so loathe ; but i need to see a bad film every once in a while .  and , you know what , mighty joe young doesn't qualify .  far from being bad , mighty joe young is actually a family fun movie .  it's enjoyable , appropriate , cute , cuddly , and all of those other things that i've been seeing in every movie since a bug's life .  mighty joe young tracks a 2 , 000 pound gorilla in the wilds of africa that is taken to a reserve in . . .  california ?   . . .  for safe-keeping .  okay .  a little unrealistic , but who ever said a kid's movie had to have the slightest hint of realism .  the first half of the movie is a gorillas in the mist-esque hatred of poachers woman-of-the-wild motif .  the second half is a straight up parody of king kong , awestruck onlookers and all .  mark one down .  i'm feeling relaxed .  it is , as a point of fact , an extremely un-creative movie .  but , as a vetern , i can say quite honestly that creativity doesn't count for as much as it should .  so that saves mighty joe from my wrath , although my colleagues and cohorts and surely bashing this film at this very moment .  this is not the film to take a girl on a date to .  it's not the film for you .  it's the film for you and your family .  when you're right alongside your kid , all of the normal rights and wrongs slip away .  the same thing happens when you watch a horror movie or an action flick .  it becomes fun .  all you have to do to enjoy mighty joe young is shut up and watch .  
there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review , not because of their own complexity , but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original .  one of such masterpieces is casablanca , probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art , but definitely the most popular one .  its popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere , but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day .  casablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience .  one of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail , at least judging by conventional movie-making wisdom of its time .  it was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn't been produced on stage ; screenplay by three writers - julius g . epstein , philip j . epstein and howard koch - was beeing written as shooting went along ; the main actors were producers' second choice , and , finally , man behind camera , michael curtiz was considered to be capable , but not great director .  however , the movie was commercially successful and earned three " oscars " , including the one for the best film .  until this very day , it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film- making in its own golden age .  the plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww2 propaganda , yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story .  in december 1941 , casablanca , exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral , yet nazi-collaborating french vichy government .  thousands of refugees from war-torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america , and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas .  many shady characters thrive on their misery , including the corrupt police chief , captain renault ( rains ) .  his best friend is rick blaine ( bogart ) , who used to be idealistic anti-fascist , and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy of " sticking his neck for nobody " .  however , everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas .  this event coincides with the arrival of two new refugees to casablanca .  one of them is victor laszlo ( henreid ) , czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe .  he is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund ( bergman ) , with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris .  the couple needs visas , especially because of the gestapo major strasser ( veidt ) being on their trail .  rick is now forced to choose between love , wounded pride , self-preserving interest and his own hatred of fascism .  the casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration - humphrey bogart , most legendary actor in the history of cinema , is one of the rare character actors who elevated his persona to the star status .  bogart's portrayal of rick as complicated man , torn between idealistic past and bitter present , was so perfect , that his icon would forever be connected with that character .  another icon in his company is ingrid bergman , great actress of old hollywood , here in her artistic and visual prime .  the cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking - some happier times when the romance on the screen didn't look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works .  for many people , casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made .  but the reason for that isn't the romance itself - it's the realistic story of people forced to make tough , and often wrong choices in their life .  the casting of casablanca was right on target not just in a case of main leads .  the supporting actors also did a marvellous job .  sidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic - john huston's maltese falcon ; yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters .  another shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle ; character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny .  unfortunately , the charisma that burdened laszlo , leaves little place for difficult choice , making his character forever overshadowed by rick/ilsa coupling .  however , rick and ilsa actually have a serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca .  captain renault , brilliantly portrayed by claude rains in a role of a lifetime , was embodiment of perfect , almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm .  despite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie , rains managed to make renault sympathetic character , and his final conversion to the side of good , symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary .  rains also gave another dimension to the movie , making it even more ambiguous ; people who like to analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality in renault's relationship towards rick , and rick's final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations .  together with well-drawn characters and exciting story , the movie was good in creating his own atmosphere .  professional nitpickers would probably have a field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies , but casablanca is still a shining example of hollywood ww2 movie that is beliavable , if not realistic .  any way , even if we don't see it as a historical document , casablanca is movie that can be source of entertainment as well as infinite inspiration .  
 " well this is not mission : difficult , mr . hunt , it's mission : impossible .  difficult should be a walk in the park for you . "  ---agent swanbeck ( sir anthony hopkins ) , the series' new agent phelps , takes ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) down a notch .  a russian scientist ( rade serbedzija ) has created a new virus ( and its antidote ) called chimera that destroys its host within twenty hours of injection .  a rogue imf agent , sean ambrose ( dougray scott ) , wants to use the disease and cure to blackmail a pharmaceutical company into selling him enough stock to make him owner of the company ( he knows it will soon be worth its weight in gold thanks to the outbreak of the virus he is going to cause ) .  posing as ethan hunt , ambrose gains the confidence of the scientist long enough to get only the cure , not realizing that the scientist had injected himself with the virus to prevent exactly what ambrose was trying to do .  the real ethan hunt is called in from his vacation to persuade beautiful thief nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) to assist the imf team in retrieving the stolen goods .  ethan and nyah fall quickly in love , but ethan soon finds himself in a real dilemma when he learns that his new love has only been hired because she was a former lover of ambrose's .  reluctantly , he sets up nyah to be rescued from prison by ambrose so she can infiltrate his compound and send back intelligence to the team .  ethan must race against time to keep ambrose from obtaining and spreading the virus and prevent any harm from coming to nyah .  although the first mission : impossible film was a moderate box office success , audiences panned it because they felt the plot was too confusing and there wasn't much action ( although being a fan of the series both old and new , i thought the movie was pretty decent and especially gutsy to make phelps a bad guy ) .  that problem has been rectified in the sequel by making the plot more accessible ( courtesy of one of the writers of the previous entry , robert towne ) and by turning the film into one gigantic action set piece under the steady hand of action film guru john woo .  the end result is one of the most entertaining ( yet simple ) action films made in a long while .  unfortunately , the first forty minutes or so are relatively slow , dwelling mainly on ethan and nyah's quickly blossoming romance and seeming more in place in a james bond film than with the less glamorous mission : impossible tv series .  ethan's conflict is a compelling one , but it seems very rushed ( and comes about because of a near fatal car wreck that ethan himself causes ! ) .  john woo handles all of this with an artistic flair that seems out of place , featuring a great deal of slow fades and dramatically framed close-ups .  the surreal nature of these sequences are distracting and ultimately a detriment to the film .  thankfully though , at the point ambrose discovers nyah's deception , mission : impossible ii becomes very entertaining and action-packed .  robert towne's screenplay takes some of the conventions set up in the first film and parodies them during a sequence where ethan must break into a high-rise building and retrieve the remaining specimens of the virus .  after that , the action scenes just begin to build in intensity , as is the case with many of woo's previous high-octane films .  the final half hour is an all out assault of action ( a good deal of which is ruined by the trailer , unfortunately ) .  as far as summer entertainment goes , mission : impossible ii is serviceable fare .  anyone looking for hardcore action won't be disappointed ( except for during the first half of the film , perhaps ) .  even if you weren't a fan of the first film , this entry deserves some checking out .

everyone's heard about this movie , and more specifically , * the * scene .  everyone's heard the famous barnyard animal quote squealed ( no pun intended ) over and over .  and everyone's got to admit that they will never travel down a river again without thinking of deliverance .  good !  that's what you're supposed to do !  oh , if you are one of the ones who hasn't seen this yet , or you ( somehow ) haven't heard about what happens , here's your spoiler warning .  deliverance was a real shocker for it's time ( 1972 ) .  major advances were being made in films , and deliverance made its own advances when it introduced a new horror into the film industry .  when it was first released , it literally shocked the audiences .  it was something that , for the most part , had really never been seen on the big screen before ( among wide-release films with an r rating ) .  but by today's film standards and in today's world , such scenes as the one in deliverance can be reproduced in a way that isn't as shocking , although they can be even more graphic ( e . g .  pulp fiction ) .  pulp fiction did it in a way , and expanded on it in a way , that it could even be interpreted as funny .  but in 1972 , deliverance was no laughing matter .  the story centers around a group of four atlanta men who decide to take a rafting trip down a backwoods river in georgia while the river is still there and in its glory .  the initial leader of the group is lewis ( burt reynolds in his prime ) , a real outdoorsman and more of a daniel boone-type then any of the others .  joining him are ed ( jon voight ) , bobby ( ned beatty ) , and drew ( ronny cox ) .  the group's first objective is to find someone ( s ) to drive their cars down the river to the point where they will end their trip .  they make arrangements with a few mountain men , who accept $40 . 00 for the task .  drew also has the famous " dueling banjos " competition with a local who is , let us say , genetically challenged .  the men then set off down the river , with lewis , also the master at canoeing , leading the way .  everything seems to be going fine , until the two canoes split up , leaving the unexperienced ed and bobby alone .  they encounter two hillbillies , armed with a shotgun , who captured them .  ed is tied to a tree while bobby is sodomized by one of the men .  ed nearly receives the same cruelty , but lewis arrives just in time to fire an arrow through the rapist's back .  the other hillbilly gets away , and the men have to decide what to do with the dead body .  disposing of dead bodies is done rather frequent throughout this film .  while attempting to make a quick " paddle for it " , both canoes tip over .  drew , who was without a life jacket , was possibly shot and cannot be found .  lewis suffered a rather nasty compound fracture during the incident and is in serious condition .  this leaves ed and bobby .  ed decides to go out and look for the remaining hillbilly , alone , with the bow and arrow .  the question arises if he will be able to handle himself , as he horribly botched a first shot attempt at a deer , to which his comment " i wonder how anyone could kill a living thing " will have more meaning in the future .  deliverance is definitely a wild ride ( oops , i'm doing it again ) .  it is extremely tense at some points and very dramatic .  it's definitely one of those " must see " movies and should be considered one of the classics of its decade .  
it has happened again .  a movie that is well scripted , well acted , and well directed .  it is involving , suspenseful . . .  it even has an unexpected twist at the end that packs a punch like a blow to the solar plexus .  but in order to accept its premise one must also accept a spiritual lie .  the sixth sense is that movie .  starring bruce willis ( armageddon ) as a child psychologist and haley joel osment ( forrest gump ) as a troubled youngster , the sixth sense is more spooky than scary , though it does contain disturbing images designed to startle .  eight-year-old cole sear ( osment ) sees dead people .  not just in dreams .  and not just as lifeless bodies .  he sees them walking around like regular people .  and he sees them all the time .  dr . malcolm crowe ( willis ) is trying to help him .  he recognizes in cole many of the same attributes as one of his earlier patients whom crowe failed , resulting in that patient shooting crowe before turning the gun on himself .  if crowe could manage to find a way to help cole , he believes he just might be able to put his own demons to rest .  but first he needs to gain cole's trust .  the boy is so frightened by what he sees , he has closed himself off emotionally , being unwilling to tell anyone . . .  not crowe , not even his own mother ( toni collette , clockwatchers ) . . .  about his " secrets . "  crowe begins to spend more and more time with him , even as his own marriage starts to dissolve around him , his wife anna ( olivia williams , rushmore ) becoming cold and distant because of his neglect of her and his preoccupation with the boy .  bruce willis underplays his role , allowing the excellent script to do most of the work of building character development .  crowe moves from treating a troubled boy who won't communicate , to treating a troubled boy who is having hallucinations , to wondering if perhaps there isn't some truth behind what the boy sees .  mr . willis does a serviceable job , letting the focus remain on the story instead of on his familiar action hero screen persona .  eleven-year-old haley joel osment manages to impress us with his performance .  he demonstrates an amazing amount of self-composure as well as an ability to play nuances in a complex character as if he were a seasoned pro .  it is fine work for one of such a tender age .  keep your eye on this young man .  the supporting cast is also quite effective .  toni collette , as the confused , frightened , and frustrated mother who can't understand what is happening to her child ; olivia williams , as crowe's once loving wife who is shutting down emotionally due to the lack of attention from her husband ; and donnie wahlberg ( ransom ) as crowe's ex-patient , now grown , who illustrates his doctor's failure to help him in the most vivid terms imaginable .  twenty-eight year old m . night shyamalan ( wide awake ) directed his own script , maintaining a proper tension throughout the film and crafting the storytelling so expertly that the film's full impact is not reached until its final moments , when a surprising revelation forces a reevaluation of all that preceded it .  it is a rare movie which manages to pull that off and mr . shyamalan , as the one responsible , is certainly to be commended .  in giving the sixth sense a favorable " three star " review for its craftsmanship and artistic merit , i must also point out that , spiritually speaking , the film is highly misleading .  there is no scriptural foundation upon which to base a belief in ghosts or the " living dead . "  the concept of death being a doorway to another plane of existence is a devilish lie that has been around as long as man himself .  the first lie recorded in the bible was devised by the serpent who assured eve , " thou shall not surely die , " a direct contradiction of god's admonition .  that same lie has been perpetuated ad infinitum throughout the ages .  scriptures do speak of a time when the dead shall rise but that wonderful demonstration of victory over death will not commence until after the second coming of christ . . .  an event which has not yet occurred .  therefore , the dead remain in a state of oblivion , having no consciousness , until that long-awaited time when the final trump shall sound .  and then , you'll need six senses to register all the joy and rejoicing that will resound throughout the heavens .  
i was pleasantly surprised by this film .  with a budget topping $200 million , i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century's greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see .  how much could you dress up the sets ?  how many models and computer effects could you use ?  how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks ?  oh , if i've just given away part of the plot for you , go back to school .  after having viewed titanic , however , i found it to be a well-paced , well-designed , and overall well-made movie .  there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic , but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i've seen .  titanic tells its story in two time periods .  it starts out in the present , when ocean explorer brock lovett ( bill paxton ) and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic , searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship .  what they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace , which is broadcast on the news .  the woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett , who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas .  there she tells her story to lovett and his team .  in 1912 , rose dewitt bukater ( kate winslett ) , a young lady belonging to society's upper class , boards the titanic for the ship's first atlantic crossing , from southampton , england to new york .  she is engaged to cal hockley ( billy zane ) , an heir to old money , and a snob in every sense of the word .  on board , rose feels the stifling trappings of high-society's expectations , and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic's stern , but is saved from her self-proclaimed fate by jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a passenger in third-class ( " steerage " , as it's referred to ) , who talks her out of jumping .  although for rose the attraction is not immediate , a love affair soon develops between the two , which endangers rose's social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal .  the story sounds very simple , and perhaps even unexciting , but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron , a good movie comes through .  dicaprio is marvelous as the young , but worldly-wise jack , playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors .  his is a character that is immediately likable , as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations .  girls are going to swoon over him .  winslet also proves herself a good actress , delivering her lines convincingly , and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable .  the only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character's upbringing .  simply by judgment of her gait , i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper-crust debutante .  rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess , she sometimes looks positively clumsy , and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting .  billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal , since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him .  his features are such that even when he smiles , there's something mistrustful about him , and when he scowls , he is evil incarnate .  he's something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher , but a cheaper model .  like dicaprio and winslet , zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well .  backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy , cal's personal assistant ( or " man " as they said at the turn of the century ) .  no matter who else is in the cast , you can always count on a good performance by warner , who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match .  additionally , there are a number of smaller fictional and non-fictional roles thrown in for color , such as kathy bates as " the unsinkable " molly brown , danny nucci as jack's friend fabrizio de rossi , eric braeden as john jacob astor , and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie .  nice to see dr . bombay getting work .  also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die .  this by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic , but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ship's crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the first-class passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else .  in this way , titanic possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures .  you don't just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop , but a very real account of class struggle as well .  as i mentioned before , the budget for this film was tremendous , and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects .  the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail , and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic .  with regard to the exteriors , i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale .  cameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank , but only had room for 90% , and therefore had to computer-generate the remaining 40 feet .  could've fooled me and everyone else in the theater , as the splicing is seamless .  also of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning .  we are told of where the iceberg struck the ship , how the flooding occurred , the way the ship sank , and why it did so in that manner .  these technical details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts happening , and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction , in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion .  in all , james cameron's titanic is a good blend of love story , history , and action .  the fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewer's attention is held alternately by those three main elements , from the movie's intriguing beginning to it's satisfactory ending .  in box office receipts , titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship .  
the laserman : somehow the title of writer-director-producer peter wang's film conjures up images of superheroes , like ultraman and spiderman .  you kind of expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips .  as it turns out , the laserman _is_ about crime and about laser beams , but there aren't any superheroes .  instead , wang's film is populated by a group of refreshingly off-beat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot : new york city .  the laserman is a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity , eccentricity , and electricity .  the film tells the bizarre story of arthur weiss ( marc hayashi ) , a chinese-american laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidentally kills his lab assistant in an experiment .  he loses his job but finds work with a mysterious company which secretly plans to use laser technology to commit dastardly deeds .  arthur's professional life is cluttered with moral dilemmas .  his personal life , on the other hand , is cluttered with colorful friends and quirky relatives .  in fact , arthur is by far the blandest character in the film , despite a charismatic performance by hayashi ( the san francisco-based actor whose films include chan is missing and the karate kid ii ) .  it's the auxiliary characters who give the laserman its unique spark .  arthur's not-so-typical jewish mother , ruth , for example , is convinced that a chinese soul is trapped in her jewish body .  she has dyed her red hair black , she takes herbal medicine daily , and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies , such as matzo balls in soy sauce--the ultimate fusion of jewish and chinese cuisine .  veteran stage actress joan copeland takes the part and runs with it , almost stealing the movie in the process .  she plays ruth as a driven woman , determined to overcome her genetic heritage by immersing herself in chinese culture .  arthur's girlfriend janet ( maryann urbano ) is a kooky free-spirit who would rather meditate than copulate ; her ultimate goal is orgasm through zen meditation .  arthur's best friend , joey ( tony leung ) , is a small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens to machine guns .  joey is married to arthur's jewish sister , but he is also having an affair with a chinese immigrant who works in a whore house .  arthur's 11-year-old son , jimmy , played by the amazingly adorable david chan , is--horror of horrors--bad at math !  he finds it impossible to meet his father's lofty expectations .  the various people in arthur's life come together to form a rich tapestry of humanity .  like wang's earlier film , a great wall ( about a san francisco family visiting relatives in china ) , the laserman revolves around cultural differences .  every character in the film is , in some way or another , trying to find his identity--struggling to negotiate a balance between his native culture and the american way .  the movie also offers a provocative look at technology .  wang appears in the movie as lieutenant lu , a detective who is fed up with machines , even though he relies on them to do his job .  the film views technology with a wary eye , acknowledging its necessity while at the same time realizing its potential dangers .  wang raises the time-honored question of whether scientists should be held responsible for their inventions .  was einstein responsible for the a-bomb ?  is arthur weiss responsible for his lasers ?  the movie pits spirituality against technology , man against machine , and the result is a draw .  according to the film , technology has its place , but we must employ it with great forethought and caution .  ironically , by its very nature , the laserman is a triumph of technology--the technology of filmmaking .  wang's direction is exquisite , especially during the tense finale in which the director frantically cross-cuts between the various subplots , perhaps in homage to d . w .  griffith .  cinematographer ernest dickerson , who has worked on all of spike lee's films , gives the laserman a distinctive , artistic look .  mason daring's score , which includes a send-up of bach , is right on target .  the laserman is an ambitious endeavor , which is to be applauded , but it's sometimes ambitious to a fault .  wang serves up so many slices of life in the film that it's hard to digest them all .  for instance , one character ( arthur's sister ) has negligible screen time , and consequently we just don't care about her marital problems .  in weaving his web , wang has included a few too many strands .  overall , however , the laserman is a charmingly eclectic concoction .  on the surface , the film is a light and bouncy comedy-thriller , overflowing with whimsical humor and visual style .  the heavier issues emerge only when you take a deeper look at the film .  you can ponder the moral questions or you can just sit back and enjoy the absurdity of life in china town .  
 " say , any of you know how to madison ? "  --- brad " asshole " majors ( barry bostwick ) shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show .  the story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend .  in the early 70's , stage actor turned first-time playwright richard o'brien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy b-movies he had grown up with as a child , set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design .  the result was the stage play the rocky horror show , which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973 and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england .  the play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later , in october of 1974 .  the film version ( now titled the rocky horror picture show ) was released in 1975 . . .  and immediately tanked at the box office .  whether it was because fox wasn't quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn't quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined , but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop .  it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters .  a year later , something entirely strange and magical happened .  prints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country , and it was then that a whole new audience found the film .  this new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film , acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played , yelling rude comments at the screen , and just generally having a good time .  word quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show's life as the ultimate cult film was born .  for the virgins out there who are unaware , the plot centers around a loving couple , brad majors ( barry bostwick ) and janet weiss ( susan sarandon ) , who come from a small town called denton .  brad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed .  they plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting , dr . everett scott ( jonathan adams , who played the narrator in the original stage version ) , but their car gets a flat on the way to his home .  remembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road , they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance .  the castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual ( in the galaxy of transylvania ) , who are lead by the eccentric fishnet-stocking wearing mad scientist dr . frank-n-furter ( tim curry ) .  frank-n-furter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky ( peter hinwood ) .  as rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment , brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank-n-furter's mad schemes .  little do any of them know that the doctor's handyman , riff-raff ( original author richard o'brien ) , and domestic , magenta ( patricia quinn ) , are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth .  going back and revisiting this film after ten years ( 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it ) , it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has .  if i had been a fox executive around the time of its release , i don't think i would have known what to make of it either .  for all intents and purposes it is a bad movie ( though bad in a really good sort of way ) , but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film .  by the time the credits role , it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters , and one really gets the feeling that richard o'brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b-movies his film is based on .  when i say that the wall-to-wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that , once you hear them , they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity .  it goes without saying that the " time warp " is the most popular song in the film .  even people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song .  what those who haven't seen the movie don't know though , is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment .  my personal favorite is " over at the frankenstein place " , but " dammit janet " is also maddeningly catchy .  tim curry's vocals on the rocking tune " sweet transvestite " need to be heard to be believed .  the finale of the film , a big floor show staged by frank-n-furter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets ( including barry bostwick . . .  frightening ! ) , features no less than four songs ( " rose tint my world " , " don't dream it " , " wild and untamed thing " , and " i'm going home " ) , all of which are immensely singable .  the film's true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though .  despite the catchiness of the songs , this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn't have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show .  watching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans ( unless you don't mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place ) .  note : director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film , in the form of a sequel , resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment , which picks up with brad and janet ( this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper ! ) as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton .  the two are menaced by the evil tv station manager ( also played by de young ) , who wishes to claim janet as his own .  o'brien returned as a writer/performer on the project ( as did quinn , campbell , and gray in performance capacity only ) , but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original .  25 years later , this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world .  as a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans , a brand new special edition 2-disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date ( even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its 20th anniversary ) .  if you are one of those people who can't get enough of the film , this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites .  in an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film , fox home entertainment has released this wonderful 2-disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it'll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all .  the film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) .  the film is presented in two different versions , the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called " superheroes " .  for ambitious viewers , the disc also includes a hidden version ( located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner ) which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen .  originally , the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz , with the first half of the it seen in black and white ( and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number ) .  most reports , including a documentary on the disc , say that the color was supposed to appear when frank-n-furter first shows up in the elevator , but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version , depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced .  the film contains a commentary track by show creator ( and faithful handyman ) richard o'brien and co-star patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable ( and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and half-naked on freezing cold sets , which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews ) .  the two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell , but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore ( and there are quite a few ) .  fox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments .  the first feature ( and the most simple ) is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is .  the second feature is an audience participation track , which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show .  most of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off , but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter .  the final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd , where a pair of lips will appear on-screen during certain scenes of the film ( mostly during the musical numbers ) that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote .  when selected , you will be taken out of the film and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world .  once the segment is over , you are deposited right back into the film where you left off .  the first disc also contains a few dvd-rom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player .  there is a timeline of the evolution from the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation , a video jukebox , a you don't know jack-styled trivia game ( which is about as bare bones a you don't know jack parody as it can be ) , and a bizarre mad-libs styled word game known as riff-raff's story lab .  links to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvd-rom portion of the disc .  the second disc features even more goodies for the person who loves extras .  former lite-rock video channel turned music historians vh-1 have allowed some of their outtake footage from the " behind the music : rocky horror " special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here , as well as a pop-up video for the meat loaf-sung " hot patootie " .  the " behind the music " segments are all very interesting , especially richard o'brien's jaunt through the castle ( which is now a hotel ! ) where the film was originally shot .  there are also extensions of the sarandon , bostwick , quinn , o'brien , and meat loaf interviews .  as far as extras for the film itself go , there are two deleted musical numbers that are also included here .  one of which is just the " superheroes " number available in the uk version , but there is also another rare musical number presented here called " once in a while " .  a series of alternate takes are also presented here , but none of them are really much of a revelation ( except for the undressing scene in which we see that patricia quinn is having a hard time unbuttoning barry bostwick's pants ) .  for the completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphernalia , a misprinted end sequence and alternate credit sequence are also presented here .  rounding out the disc is a decent documentary called rocky horror double feature video show , two theatrical trailers ( proclaiming that the film is " a different sort of jaws " ) , a still gallery , and two sing-a-longs ( for " toucha toucha touch me " and " sweet transvestite " ) .  fox's special edition is the dvd set that rocky horror fans have been waiting for all their lives ( " you're lucky . . .  i'm lucky . . .  he's lucky . . .  we're all lucky ! " ) .  it's not just amazing enough that tons of classic italian films are finally getting their recognition in the u . s . , but even long standing traditions are finally receiving their due on the wonderful dvd format .  as with their excellent dvds of the abyss , fight club , independence day , and the sound of music , fox shows that they have most certainly made the commitment to provide the things that dvd lovers want .  i raise a toast to them ( cue the throwing of the bread ) as i cut out the lights , sit back , and watch those disembodied lips begin to sing about b-movie tradition .

when i first heard of contact , the hype was building it up as a sci-fi blockbuster .  now , with that in mind , coupled with the knowledge of jodie foster's involvement in the project , i thought " what in the world is foster doing in a sci-fi blockbuster ? ? ? " .  as it turned out , my expectations were completely nullified and turned topsy-turvy .  robert zemeckis , back from the euphoria created by his last film , forrest gump , once again proves his mastery in fusing tales of adventure with along the endearing lines of human spirit .  don't get me wrong , contact is sci-fi ? but with a definite difference .  based on the late carl sagan novel of the same name , the story delves itself in questions on science and god ; fact and faith .  allie ( foster ) is a radio astronomer .  she spends her time listening to the stars , via ultra-huge communication dishes in search of intelligent life beyond the solar system .  her passion for `long-distance communication' is the result of her younger days being spent avidly in front of a ham-radio system ( a hobbyist radio communication device ) which her late-father bought for her .  a scene which particularly strengthens the audiences' view of the passion is when she asked her father whether she could contact her late-mother through the ham-radio system in which her father replied " not even the most powerful radio in the world can do that , now " .  allie's research is based on the seti project ( search for extra terrestrial intelligence ) , in which she listens to radio emissions from other galaxies in the hope of finding one which would suggest intelligent manipulation .  her work has never been off the scrutiny of the us government , which considers it a waste of taxpayer's money and politically unviable , her supervisor ( tom skerritt ) pulls the plug on seti .  undaunted , allie managed to gather a loyal group of `believers' and eventually found funding from a large private corporation .  the following months were treacherous to their hopes and research as they are contantly pressured by the government but all that changed when one day , she caught an emission of a seemingly intelligent repeating sound-wave .  the news of her find attracted hordes of alien believers , cultist , the media and of course , the government .  the situation became intense upon her discovery of pictorial plans on building a form of transport which were embedded within the repeating sound emission .  as the world join forces to build this transport , allie is desperate to be the one to go .  she enrols herself among a few hopefuls , to represent the world when the transport is ready for operation .  her eligibility for the spot failed when she is questioned on her beliefs in the existence of god by the president's spiritual advisor ( mcconaughey ) ; allie , being an atheist , a result of her belief in fact and science , refuses to budge upon questioning .  at this point the movie plot thickens considerably as she is romantically involved with the president's spiritual advisor .  a strong point which propelled the movie is the depth of its main characters played by foster and mcconaughey .  from the very first meeting scene , it is obvious that the two of them was sort of kindred spirits but they were worlds apart in almost all aspects , foster being a person drawn to science and facts and mcconaughey being one who believes in faith , hope and the power of the unseen .  the meeting of their worlds , added with the situation which they are put into makes the entire storytelling process near flawless .  many people who read the synopsis of this film would find it a tad too ridiculous , but by actually immersing yourself in it , gives you an entirely different perspective ; one which is free from bias and pre-conceptions .  zemeckis and his team of screen writers have done a remarkable job in telling this tale through film .  contact works by not delving in controversy but rather , touches the thinking audience , urging them to ponder upon the questions raised in the film concerning fact and faith ; whether one can actually find compromise within .  i consider contact as one of the must-sees for this year .  
luckily , some people got starship troopers .  some people knew it was supposed to be silly .  for those of you who didn't , how could you miss it ?  from the very beginning , when we see an interactive internet-like promotional video for the armed forces of the future , it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly .  i guess without blatant one-liners and home alone style slapstick , some people just don't recognize such goofy humor .  such a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned .  first thing to do before seeing this movie - lighten up .  meet the equivalent of " beverly hills 90210 " meets " mighty morphin power rangers " .  four close friends are now graduating high school and are ready to join the armed forces , which , in the future , means fighting for the whole galaxy and not just your country .  johnny rico ( casper van dien ) is ready to join the infantry , mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) has enlisted to be a pilot .  dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) has enlisted as a trooper , and it's possible she's joining merely to follow rico , whom she's always had eyes for .  if you saw these three on the street , you'd automatically start searching for the fashion designers and photographers , for never has a movie's cast looked so much like the cut-out cover of " seventeen " magazine .  the lone non-supermodel , carl jenkins ( played by doogie howser himself , neil patrick harris ) is the brainiac who gets into the military intelligence division , the top secret department that pretty much leaves doogie - er , carl out of the picture .   ( good call - now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters ) .  right off the bat , rico becomes the star of the show , far surpassing all the other soldiers and becoming squadron leader in a short period of time .  but a horrific accident during a standard training exercise ( which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen ) leaves rico ready to call it quits .  with his bags packed and his civilian clothes back on , johnny is ready to walk off base and catch the next flight home .  well sorry , rico suave , but there's no place like home , especially after gigantic alien insects have destroyed it .  that's right , the planet is being attacked by a colony of arachnid-like alien beings that a can of raid just isn't going to destroy .  with a sudden change of heart ( and clothes ) , rico is back in the game , following his fellow starship troopers off to fight a mean group of daddy long legs .  what starship troopers really is , is a spoof of all that it even remotely touches on - the soap opera like love affairs of high school , the love for sci-fi and thirst for gore shared by this same age group , etc . nothing is taken seriously .  it's almost as much a satire on young adults as clueless , but with its sly and futuristic approach , it's not as recognizably so .  it's a spoof so subtle that many won't recognize the spoofery .  if you deem this as sci-fi/action , you're wrong .  it's sci-fi/action/comedy , with the comedy being on the level of such cult favorites as evil dead 2 . starship troopers just may be on the road to cult status as well .  gore is a factor heavily brought up in reviews of this film , but the gore , too , is meant to be cheesy .  yes , it's graphic , but it's also brutally phony , and that's what makes it such great fun to watch .  not since the old " mr . bill " skits on " saturday night live " has torture and mutilation been such a joy to watch .  people were laughing out loud every time a body was severed in half or a head was viciously decapitated .  perhaps it brings back fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters' barbie dolls as young children .  with the actors resembling ken and barbie so closely , it's a good chance this is the case , whether we're fully aware of it or not .  starship troopers has it's slow parts , but it's truly an alternative to your typical sci-fi/action flick or lame juvenile comedy .  aside from the intentionally cheesy gore , the special effects are quite astounding .  when the spaceship passes a meteor , it's quite an awesome spectacle , visually crisp and captivating .  if you're looking for brainless fun , this is the epitome of your search .  a beautiful cast , awesome special effects , fast-paced action , campy acting , and a whole lot of gore .  this is brainless heaven .  just remember not to think .  
quiz show , an almost perfectly accurate true story , is based upon the events of the popular television show of the mid-50's , " twenty-one " .  on this trivial game show , contestants were placed in isolation booths and then answered questions corresponding to a category of their choice , on which they wagered an amount of points on .  the game went on until a player reached twenty one points on felt they had earned enough points to win .  but , after ratings began to fall when players were struggling to break the zero mark , the producers decided to fix the game by giving the answers to a contestant before the game began .  quiz show illustrates the true stories of two particular contestants , herbie stempel and charles van doren .  stempel ( john turturro ) , a former g . i .  and your jewish man raising a family .  stempel has been the reigning champion on " twenty-one " for many weeks and has accumulated thousands of dollars .  in his mind , he is the best thing on television and the people love him .  although , in the mind of the show's producers , herbie stempel is getting old .  dan enright ( david paymer ) , in particular , feels that the people are tired of seeing a " jewish guy from queens with bad teeth " and that the kids need someone better to look up to .  therefore , they need to find another contestant whom would be a worthy role model and the people will look up to and cheer to win .  someone who can defeat stempel , even if they have to resort to cheating .  enter charles van doren ( ralph fiennes ) , a well-educated professor from a widely recognized family .  van doren had decided to try out for the game show " tic tac dough " because his friends thought he would be good at that sort of thing .  but when albert freedman ( hank azaria ) , enright's assistant , spots van doren , the two decide that they have found their soon-to-be-ruler of the " twenty-one " kingdom .  van doren is not too keen on the idea of receiving the answers ahead of time , so enright tells stempel that he is going to give the wrong answer , on purpose , in order to lose the game .  after stempel loses the " throne " to van doren , he starts to feel cheated ( which he should ) .  meanwhile , on his own , dick goodwin ( rob morrow ) , a harvard law graduate , has decided to start an investigation on " twenty-one " to try and find out if there have been any wrongdoings .  his investigation yields shocking results and leads to a trial for enright and the others involved .  quiz show is an extremely well done movie , and robert redford's direction is especially superb .  the performances turned in by john turturro , ralph fiennes , and rob morrow are very good , although it seems that turturro stands out more than any .  quiz show is also very precise when it comes to explicating the true events that inspired the film .  definitely a film you should not miss .  
1992's alien3 marked not only the death ( by suicide ) of its popular protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , but , in many ways , the alien franchise itself--box office receipts were anemic , thanks to poor audience word of mouth ; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments , 1979's alien and 1986's aliens , savaged david fincher's slog of a sendoff ( myself included ) .  hence , weaver , director jean-pierre jeunet , and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two-fold challenge--not only somehow resurrect ripley , but also rescue this once-profitable series from the scrap heap .  despite the odds , they have succeeded , even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two .  writer joss whedon devises a quick , easy , and painless answer to the dead ripley problem--clone her , which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 , the prison planet of the third film .  that done , the _real_ challenge presents itself--what do with her .  alien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful ; aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable , exploring her maternal side ; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death .  what could be next ?  whedon comes up with a clever spin : since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen , the blood used for the clone is also " infected " with alien dna .  so the new ripley is , indeed , new--a human/alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength , a psychic bond with the deadly species , and a more predatory attitude .  unfortunately , that is where alien resurrection's clever streak in writing stops .  the alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features .  but the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought .  the movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding , but once the creatures break free , it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew ( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers , including tough waif call , played by a game winona ryder ) trying to exterminate them .  and the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential ; i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy .  while the settling into tried-and-true formula is a little disconcerting , the formula is tried-and-true for a reason , and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon .  the alien , after all these years , is still terrifying , and a new breed that is introduced is no less so .  the violence is appropriately grisly and extreme , and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting , most notably an extended underwater sequence .  the film is absolutely mesmerizing visually , thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji .  as technically adept as jeunet's direction is , perhaps his ( and , for that matter , whedon's ) greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series .  a sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for , but the self-awareness of the excess just adds to the fun .  no , alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scott's alien or the even greater film that james cameron's aliens was .  but after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of fincher's alien3 , jeunet's resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild , reckless thrill ride .  that is what made the alien series so popular in the first place , and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments .  
american pie acknowledges a cold , hard fact that most movies don't : it is very difficult to get laid .  its four virgin heroes are jim ( biggs ) , a chronic masturbator , kev ( nicholas ) , who desperately wants to deflower his girlfriend ( reid ) , oz ( klein ) , a lacrosse player whose approach requires some fine tuning , and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) , a germphobe ( his crass nickname is hilarious , but i won't spoil it here ) who pays a classmate to spread rumours about the size of his member .  jim , kev , oz and finch attend a high school in suburban michigan full of so many impossibly beautiful women it's no wonder they're horny all the time .  after a party at their studly friend stifler's ( seann william scott , in the film's sharpest performance ) house leaves them sexually unsatisfied , the quartet make a pact : to " lose it " by graduation-specifically , prom night , which is only a few weeks away .  american pie is in the tradition of bachelor party or revenge of the nerds .  almost every conversation these characters have revolves around makin' whoopee .  all women are there to be ogled .   ( alyson hannigan's perky music student is the only memorable female of the bunch . )  situations abound that defy logic only to arouse and/or amuse its core audience , adolescent boys .   ( to arouse : nadia's ( shannon elizabeth ) internet striptease-an unexpectedly raucous ( and guiltily pleasurable ) sequence .  to amuse : jim's lusty encounter with a hot apple pie . )  what differentiates american pie from those dirty eighties comedies , aside from a very nineties obsession with bodily fluids * , is a cast that's light years more appealing than that of , say , just one of the guys .  two more standouts : klein and " sctv " 's eugene levy .  klein plays a kind-hearted athlete for the second time in a row , after alexander payne's underappreciated election .  i hope to see more of this warm actor with the disarmingly honest face very soon .  levy's is the most crowd-pleasing performance , and indeed , it's nice to see him back on the big screen in a role that makes wonderful use of that expressive brow .  american pie also wants to emulate the teen flicks your parents _would_ let you watch growing up .  it skillfully employs a broad mix of pop tunes , much like john hughes' movies did , and even pays homage to the breakfast club a couple of times , most evidently when the prom band covers simple minds' " don't you ( forget about me ) . "  the picture ultimately has a healthy , if obligatory , attitude towards safe sex-even at their most libidinous , american pie's protagonists first whip out a condom .  the filmmakers prove that socially responsible raunch is possible .  for its familiarity and for its charming leads , i recommend american pie , but the buzz on this film had me expecting something . . . fresher .  as far as the new teen cinema goes , it's at the top of the heap .   * don't say i didn't warn you about the party scene .  
the soldiers of three kings have taken their cue from movies about vietnam .   ( fitting , since the media-saturated gulf war became a pop entertainment . )  while driving through a long , flat iraqi desert ( in a humvee with a bart simpson hood ornament ) , one of the men under special forces sgt .  maj . archie gates' ( who's steering ) command requests a beach boys tune .  these men want their apocalypse now moment , only instead of surfing , they bop to the music and skeet shoot out the back of the vehicle , armed with automatic rifles .  our three kings ( okay , four ) are good fighters , but they don't necessarily take operation desert storm seriously-it's a reprieve from their hellish day jobs .  they are gates , new father sgt .  troy barlow ( wahlberg ) , sgt .  chief elgin ( cube ) , and pvt .  conrad vig ( music video director jonze ) .  at story's start , president bush has declared a ceasefire , and american troops are tying up loose ends .  barlow , elgin , and vig discover during a round up of iraqi captives an " ass-map " that points to a bunker filled with gold bullion .  gates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation ; he proposes-demands-that barlow , elgin , and vig join him on a treasure hunt .  ditching his escort , a relentless reporter named adriana cruz ( nora dunn ) , is easy .  so is finding the treasure , until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq : saddam's men are threatening the dictator's detractors ( citizens of his own country ) with violence .  when gates and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck , ready to loot , the unarmed rebels want help .   ( bush encouraged them to rise up against the government , but provided no military support for such cause . )  gates convinces the vault's guards that this is a post-war mission , and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck .  the situation could go off without a hitch : the former enemies bear no grudges .  but the money hungry gates has a conscience , and when one female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these americans have left the scene , he orders barlow , elgin and vig to open fire on the surrounding arab forces .  the result : barlow is kidnapped , and the filmmakers imply that these would-be kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime .  barlow is eventually locked in a dank room and wired up to a shocking device .  his interrogator lost his family to the bombs , and he wants barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife and child .   ( he does , in chilling , lasting images . )  i liked these scenes best , because the political became personal .  it's one thing to champion the plight of thousands ; it's another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib .  russell has shocked us before : his first film , spanking the monkey , is about a young man's affair with his bedridden mother .   ( it's great . )  his second , flirting with disaster , features a character who has an armpit fetish .  one could argue that it's easier to make an audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions , though ; russell disturbs us in three kings by being no-nonsense about the violence .  when barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home , russell mutes the sound-we're paying attention to the debris instead of thx bombast .  three kings is russell's first visually arresting picture .  stylistically , it stands apart from other war dramas .  newton thomas sigel's cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed and extremely grainy , which is , of course , entirely appropriate .  one practically breaks out in sweat staring at the screen .   ( a friend enthusiastically added , " it's like having sand in your eyes . " )  this also helps to blur the fact that the actual locations are far removed from the persian gulf facade .   ( three kings was shot in arizona , california , and mexico . )  russell throws plenty at sigel's camera for it to observe-as was the case with russell's previous efforts , the most absurd moments are also the film's most realistic , even the most poignant .   ( we watch a bullet puncture an organ from the inside . )  if anything , three kings settles down and stops surprising us .  its climax is pure hollywood , no doubt the answer to why a major studio felt comfortable getting into bed with the indie-minded russell .  subsequently , the characters become more cartoonish-barlow's post-torture revelry felt phony , and chief , a strong presence in the first third , fails to escape the god-fearing-ultra-serious-anti-racist-black-man-of-power clich ? -so much for cube avoiding token status .   ( the arab players , on the other hand , duck stereotype . )  clooney , too , transforms into a blandly heroic protestor-marching with the rebels , i waited for him to shout , " let my people go ! "  hayseed vig notwithstanding , the protagonists are very intelligent , and self-serving , too ; i had a glimmer of hope , based on russell's filmography , that our antiheroes would revert to their greedy selves at some juncture .   ( it's not spoiling much to write that . )  then again , what historical importance would such nastiness serve ?   ( there's already enough cynicism in the film's mentioning of kuwait's oil-infested waters . )  russell offers the masses a primer on the oft-dismissed gulf conflict , and pulled off a neat trick : a war tale full of battles that takes place after a truce has been declared .  if he set out to make something socially/culturally/politically/globally significant , he succeeded .  with flair .  
i'm guessing -- and from the available evidence , it's not a great guess -- that burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess , stupidity , ego and power-mongering .  if so , the film that ended up on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history .  it has already been well-documented that the original title , an alan smithee film , became a problem when miserable test screenings forced re-cuts against the will of director arthur hiller , prompting hiller himself to opt for the directors' guild-mandated pseudonym of alan smithee .  that left a film satire in the hands of writer joe eszterhas , as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor .  and you could just smell the disaster brewing .  if you're unfortunate enough to sit through burn hollywood burn , you'll still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up .  ostensibly , it's a pseudo-documentary account of a director named alan smithee ( eric idle ) who loses control of a big-budget action film called trio starring sylvester stallone , whoopi goldberg and jackie chan ( all of whom appear as themselves ) .  when the only recourse available to him is abandoning the project to be called " an alan smithee film " -- which , of course , it already is -- smithee steals the negative of the film and threatens to destroy it .  among the parties interviewed are the film's producer james edmunds ( ryan o'neal ) and studio boss jerry glover ( richard jeni ) , who spend virtually the entire film narrating the story while painfully unfunny things go on around them .  it's bad enough that burn hollywood burn has -- literally -- not a single laugh for its entire , blissfully brief 84 minutes .  what makes it even worse is eszterhas' insistence upon telling every bad joke not once , but twice or even three times .  michael ovitz references , showgirls references , oral sex references , whoopi goldberg/ted danson references -- all show up multiple times with all the subtlety that is eszterhas' stock-in-trade .  the reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency , notably with the hilarious use of the word " feminist " as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film .  by the time coolio and chuck d show up as black independent film-makers the brothers brothers ( cleverly identified as " bad a-- " and " badder a-- " , among other unprintable things ) , you may be ready to walk out of the theater with your coat over your head to avoid being identified .  those documentary captions , for all their leaden obviousness , allow the best insight into what's so hideously wrong with burn hollywood burn .  not content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit , eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time a new character appears .  the producer is a " liar " who " slept in the white house ; " the media are " maggots " and " leeches " working for publications like " the new york slimes " and " newsleak " ( with the camera zooming in on the altered title to make sure you don't miss the joke ) .  it doesn't even matter that eszterhas tags " penile implant " after his own name when he makes a cameo , because it seems like such a desperate attempt to feign self-deprecation .  this is a petulant schoolboy's idea of satire -- pictures of hollywood insiders to which eszterhas has taken a pen to draw little moustaches and black out the teeth .  the last stomach-churning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with out-takes over the closing credits , the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour and a half of your life away .  perhaps it was just a final , desperate attempt by eszterhas to convince himself there was some purpose behind the film , or to convince everyone involved that a few blown lines warranted threatening to blow their whole career .  pity everyone involved with this excessive , ego-driven " satire " of excess and ego .  it's too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this .  otherwise , you might have seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees .  
 " first rule of fight club is , don't talk about fight club . "  this quote deals directly with my opinion of this film , because quite frankly , it's not even worth mentioning .  director david fincher ( seven ) has completely gone over the edge .  with crude humor , an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture , i'm surprised i didn't walk out .  this just goes to show that hype kills .  it's very rare that a film so hyped up as " fight club " turns out to be noteworthy , and this is no exception .  the story goes like this .  edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions , until he meets marla ( helena bonham carter ) .  norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle , when he spots her at a session that he also attended .  apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like , literally living in pain .  why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me , but things do get worse .  norton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling , and it's on a plane that he meets tyler durden ( brad pitt ) .  the two men develop a bond , and go out to a bar , and by golly after they get drunk , the two pitiful characters fight .  how do they come up with this stuff ?  anyway , their fighting catches other pathetic loser's attention , and a club is formed .  out of all this mess , there manages to lie a message .  fincher shows us that society is like robots .  we work in our jobs doing things step by step , and want out .  our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are , and we blame it on others .  call me crazy , but this is common knowledge .  i think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably .  even with two good actors , and a solid actress , they only manage to weaken the story .  i couldn't help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp .  it just shows how desperate the script is for attention .  i guess brad pitt was right for this role , because i felt like beating him up myself .  his bothersome and depressing character , made me disgusted at his 20 million fee .  it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more .  helena bonham carter however really had no purpose .  she just popped up on screen , mumbled some lines , smoked and left .  this continues for what seems like 6 hours .  the film drags on and my headache gets bigger , while " fight club " nears what i think might be the end .  unfortunately by then , the film hits rock bottom .  though the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes , it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace .  on a side note , the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film , that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer .  fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson .  concentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment , won't do any good if everything else is in need of support .  also , i'm afraid that immature men might respond to the film's violence .  the last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult .  when the film ends , i'm just glad to get home and take some advil .  you'll either enjoy what the film has to offer , or agree with ed norton when he says " this is so f * * * ing stupid . "  
there's a scene early on in " jawbreaker " where a character utters the unintentionally prophetic line , " that is * so * not funny " .  how right she was .  this pathetic tale of three high-schoolers who accidentally kill their best friend in a birthday kidnapping prank gone horribly awry is never even remotely funny .  or fun .  or original .  not content with the too-obvious " heathers " heisting , the filmmakers proceed to lift freely from a staggering variety of sources , including " carrie " , " bride of frankenstein " , " blue velvet " , and even shaw's pygmalion , itself recently remade as " she's all that " .   " jawbreaker " is a pastiche , and not even an enjoyable one .  i find it extremely telling that the most engaging part of the film is the credit sequence , a jawbreaker factory montage inexplicably backed by veruca salt's " volcano girls " ; serving as a blueprint for the rest of the film , the song has absolutely nothing to do with the footage we're watching .  just close your eyes and pretend you're listening to an alt-rock station ; you won't be missing anything .  the blame for a mess this big has to be spread around among the principals .  rebecca gayheart , following roles in " scream 2 " and " urban legend " , should have known better than to take yet another role in yet another teen body count movie .  pam grier has totally wasted any credibility she might have gotten from her role in quentin tarantino's " jackie brown " .  and rose mcgowan should just quit acting .  she has no charisma , no presence , and no acting skills other than rolling her eyes and looking disaffected .  mcgowan manages to be upstaged by her real-life boyfriend , rocker marilyn manson , whose fifteen second role here is far more interesting than anything any of the " real " actors are doing .  manson , sans trademark makeup & contact lenses , and with an obviously fake moustache , looks eerily like nicholas cage ; who woulda thunk it ?  that crack about direction by committee wasn't merely a pithy sound-bite .  stylistically , thematically & narratively , " jawbreaker " is all over the map , varying wildly in tone & content from scene to scene .  though credited solely to writer/director darren stein , one gets the feeling that no two scenes here were actually guided by the same hands .  if stein was indeed responsible for the whole of this atrocity , someone needs to get the man some drugs , pronto .  prozac , lithium , kava , ritalin , something , anything .  he's quite obviously in desperate need of chemical help .   " jawbreaker " is a monumental waste of effort and resources , and quite likely one of the single worst films i've ever seen .  to call " jawbreaker " garbage would be to insult garbage .  bad flicks for the rest of the year are safe ; i've already got my pick for worst film of '99 .   " jawbreaker " runs approximately 90 minutes , though it feels longer than " titanic " , and is rated r for language , sexual situations and graphic violence .  not recommended for kids , teens , or anyone else .  
what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable , lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project .  most of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films .  john frankenheimer , who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60's , recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin .  screenwriter ehren kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd .  ben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room , and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and 200 cigarettes .  even charlize theron , who i was convinced couldn't act , did a decent job in cider house rules .  when all of these bright stars come together , one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining .  after coming out of the theater showing reindeer games , disbelief was my first reaction ? then frustration .  the movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an all-rookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining .  the acting is so pitiful and the script so dull , i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are .  it seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights .  we have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set , it is so apparent in a number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar .  the actors in that movie were having fun and , from that , the audience had fun .  reindeer games is the complete opposite ; the actors don't seem to want to be their characters ( even danny trejo , who will do practically anything , doesn't look like he is enjoying himself ) , causing the audience to quickly lose interest .  evidence of public disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled " boy this movie is horrible ! "  and when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments .  the story follows a man , rudy ( ben affleck ) , who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick ( james frain ) .  nick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman , ashley ( charlize theron ) , and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person .  when nick is killed in a prison riot , rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on a date for the christmas holidays .  unfortunately ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) interferes with their relationship .  thinking rudy is nick , he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino , which nick use to work at as a security guard .  now rudy must pretend to be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel .  confused ?  the movie only gets more complex as it goes on , until it gets way , way too complex at its climax .  but reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour .  the hero commits a greedy , selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date ashley .  some hero .  the point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing , a person for the audience to relate to or admire .  when rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble , instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys , i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times .  the most irritating part of the film ( besides the fact that this is a christmas movie released in february ) is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason .  the routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays , especially when i eagerly want to see the hero dead .  the only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as a prisoner upset with his food .  why he was in this movie for such a pointless role beats me .  why any of these people had anything at all to do with this movie beats me .  
when i watch a movie like mike nichols' what planet are you from ?  i can't help but feel like everyone is looking at me .  it's as if all the audience is gazing at the back of my head in the darkness , eyes shooting daggers , quietly blaming me for the fact that they paid hard-earned money to spend their time watching this . . .  this . . .  thing .  i shift uncomfortably in my seat .  i'm reminded of how i feel when i see a pair of second- or third-rate celebrities engaging in a teleprompted " funny " conversation to introduce the next blockbuster award .  it's not my fault , i know it's not my fault , but dammit , someone's gotta be embarrassed , because it doesn't look like anyone on the screen is ready to take the blame .  i'm about to give you a list of names of people who are gonna make a movie together : garry shandling , annette bening , john goodman , greg kinnear , mike nichols .  do any of these names make you instantly shudder ?  the answer i would have come up with before today is no , this is quite a list of talented individuals we've got here .  granted , john goodman was in the flintstones , and greg kinnear has turned in some less-than-lackluster leading man performances in certified failures like a smile like yours , but even so , they've got proven power as excellent supporting players .  garry shandling has two television classics under his belt , his ingenious little it's garry shandling's show and the larry sanders show .  and for god's sake , mike nichols directed the graduate , and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty .  so explain this . . .  this . . .  thing .  what planet are you from ?  purports to be a comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole pop-psychology mars/venus phenomenon .  but what this movie winds up being is a collection of unfunny cringe-inducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringe-inducing moments ; the end result is , unsurprisingly , an unfunny , uninsightful , cringe-inducing , thoroughly icky embarrassment .  garry shandling plays an alien from a planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males ( they reproduce through cloning , of course ) .  his leaders put a select group of males through a series of tests designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth , find a female of the species , and impregnate her .  they're taught how to pretend that they're listening by nodding and saying " uh-huh , " and how to compliment shoes .  imagine my delighted surprise when , oh heavens , all their carefully practiced tactics turn out to fail miserably , producing comedic results !  the lucky winner is fitted with a penis ( since theirs , after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence . . .  i will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario since the population has stopped evolving due to the fact that they're all just clones . . .  whoops , too late . )  the penis , when aroused , tends to make a humming noise .  the writers , when frequently strapped for ideas , tend to turn to this as a source of " comedy . "  it isn't funny the first time .  it isn't funny the eighth time .  it isn't funny the eighteenth time .  if anything , it made me feel vaguely self-conscious .  garry meets up with a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear , who turns out to be a generic , unlikable scumbag .  he's meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandling's alien character , but he's so flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give up and toss him aside .  kinnear's scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claims other peoples' work as his own to worm his way into a vice presidents' position and goes to aa meetings to pick up chicks .  wow .  what a magnificent bastard .  nearly every man in the movie , in fact , is played as the same sort of sex-driven slimeball .  when kinnear's wife walks into the office , there isn't a single guy who doesn't trip , bump into a wall , or otherwise pratfall as if they'd never seen a woman before .  the few guys that aren't particularly slimeballs , such as john goodman's detective character , are simply uncommunicative workaholics .  shandling meets up with annette bening , who will inevitably prove to be the love he never knew existed , at one of kinnear's aa meetings .  shandling's mission is to have a baby , and when he reveals his desires to her , bening instantly falls for him , and the next day . . .  they get married .  yup .  the next day .  cuz ya see , it turns out she wants a baby too !  bening's character perhaps was the most difficult to watch , especially after seeing her come apart at the seams so effectively in american beauty . . .  if her character here is supposed to be representing the female of the species as a whole , then woe , i say , to the species .  she's unfathomably insecure , and succumbs so easily to all of shandling's lines and lies that it borders on tragic .  there's a point where , after thinking she may not be able to bear children , she learns that she is indeed pregnant .  when garry comes home after nearly cheating on her , she strolls into the kitchen and sings " high hopes " ( you know , the uplifting ant and the rubber tree plant song ) to deliver the news , and then says to him , " now you can't leave me . "  we're supposed to empathize with shandling's discovery of the feeling of " guilt , " but instead i wanted to weep for bening that she was placing her entire life and soul firmly in the lap of a great big nothing .  and eventually , shandling falls in love with her . . .  for real , i suppose , though i'm not sure exactly what prompted it .  what's the message i derive from all this ?  men are liars , inherently empty creatures , but if you hang around long enough . . .  well , maybe something will click .  ha ha . . .  ha ?  i'm thankful such broad cynicism isn't frequently allowed to run so rampant .  let's all join hands and pray that the planet these folks are from is not this one .  there's also a subplot involving john goodman as an airline incident investigator that wades in the bog of stupidity .  goodman , through a series of astoundingly implausible realizations , puts together the fact that shandling is a being from another world with a magic , vibrating penis .  it has all the makings for a subplot of having shandling be discovered , that , thankfully , never comes to the inevitable hackneyed fruition .  instead , it just dangles limply on the branch for a while , withers , and falls away .  further proof that goodman should just stick to doing coen brothers movies .  but let's not dwell on this any longer , i've already wasted plenty of your time and my own .  let's move on , forget about what we've seen here , and get on with our lives .  and to help us out , let's end things on a happy note . . .  congratuations go out to annette bening , winner of this week's " title ! "  award , for delivering the awkward line of dialog containing the movie's name .  
disillusioned and trying to find the spice of life , richard ( leonardo dicaprio ) sets off for thailand .  there he a meets crazed man by the name of daffy ( robert carlyle ) who gives him a map to a beach , a secret utopia , then commits suicide .  richard sets off for this beach with his neighbors from this hotel , ? tienne ( guillaume canet ) and fran ? oise ( virginie ledoyen ) .  once they get there the three discover a secret society existing on this beach , there richard falls for fran ? oise .  this covers about half to two thirds of the movie and aside from the romantic element , which is solely a creation of hollywood , seems to hold to the original novel .  the cinematography and general beauty of this part of the movie is breathtaking .  i don't think anyone can argue that this movie is visually stunning .  but that is were many things go wrong , darius khondji has totally outdone himself in doing the cinematography .  though the script and the interpretation of the novel are quite lacking .  the plot of the movie moves along at a decent pace for about half of the movie or there abouts .  this is where the movie has some great potential , then the three travelers get the island and there is a turn for the better , yes folks i said better .  now up to about two thirds of this movie its actually pretty good , nothing spectacular aside from the cinematography but it still has promise .  this is where things start to degenerate to something that becomes almost un-watchable .  there is even a 'video game' style sequence that borders on the disgusting , it doesn't make sense for the movie and just looks dumb in my opinion ( and i am hoping many other peoples ) .  i am hoping that in my little rant i've made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing , so if you go see it and you don't like it because of this don't blame me .  the character development was not up to par either ; i found the character of richard to be nothing more than a spoiled child .  although there is a feeble attempt to make this whole story profound it fails and richard ( leo's character ) comes off as a wannabe philosopher .  the character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go and seems to just do things for no apparent reason , granted some people are like this ( myself included ) but i nor anyone i know that is fairly random would ever do things of the sort this character does .  the next point is that some of the really interesting characters are simply not developed enough .  richard is obviously obsessed by fran ? oise at the early stages of the story , yet there is actually very little development along this story line .  this i am sure contributes to the movie's lack of core plot and being unfocused .  now , i shall move onto something a little better about the movie ( for all you cynics out there the movie did have a few good things about it ) .  the cast and acting was passable at the very least , and i think that leonardo dicaprio actually did pretty well in the role of richard .  mind you i think the rest of the cast that had some which had reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better .  which begs the question why is leonardo paid so much ?   ( i think this is a topic all on its own so i won't get into it ) .  but i like the fact that there was an international cast used , had only and american cast been used i can see this movie being horrible .  the international flavor added a more global feel to the movie that made it that much more bearable .  not to mention the movie is set in thailand and a global cast makes more sense .  when all is said and done i liked the movie for the most part but the gaping inadequacies of the plot are unforgivable .  i would not recommend this movie to anyone , the fact that i liked it has a lot to do with the cinematography and the sheer beauty of the movie not its plot or story .  as it is the story tries to be much too philosophical and fails at its attempt .  if you do end up going to see this movie be forewarned about its shortcomings .  
my inner flag was at half-mast last year when nick at nite pulled " dragnet " reruns off the air .  sure , i'd seen them all at least once , but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultra-serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv .  even though " dragnet " is out of circulation at the moment , we webb anti-fans still have the d . i . , a 50's propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous " blue boy " episode of " dragnet . "  for anyone like me who got laughs out of webb's rapid-fire speeches and straight-faced seriousness , think of the d . i .  as what would happen if sgt .  joe friday ever enlisted , because he plays exactly the same character here , a no-nonsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long- winded , melodramatic speeches on any topic .  in this election year , i'm more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth .  the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webb's office door and enters .  he gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up .  the " produced and directed by jack webb " card pretty much goes without saying .  this is his movie all the way , and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason , i was wondering if there would even be a plot .  i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants , but the d . i .  gives us more -- much more .  webb's mission is to make a man out of private owens , the local screw-up .  the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or , the captain will " personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself . "   ( whether the " lace panties " part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered . )  this , of course , gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens' life a living hell .  for those of you who haven't been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching , here's a reprint of a typical monologue of his .  i can't duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper , but the words should at least partially convey what i'm talking about . . .   " now you listen to me , youngster .  someday you'll wake up fighting on a beach and you'll pray to god somebody doesn't get killed because of your foolishness . . .  i've got a headline for you : every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours , you're gonna turn around and i'll be standing right there . "  i couldn't write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d . i .   ( nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame ) , but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines , like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day's work by going to the local bar ( where he orders a tomato juice ) .  he meets a woman who , coincidentally , also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typically-stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch-rival , another marine d . i .  webb marches over to the table , gets up in her face and says , " just what kind of a dame do you think you are ? "  bogart he ain't .  the other d . i .  gets one of the few memorable non-webb lines when he confesses to the girl , " he's a damn good d . i .   . . .  i guess i'm just a little jealous . "  join the club , we're all jealous of jack webb's way with women , which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene , as webb finds his way to the woman's place of employment , a lingerie store , and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display .   " you expect me to talk to you . . .  in _here_ ? ! " he exclaims , no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras .  the woman goes off to help a customer , leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen .  a little girl spots him in the store and demands , " what are you doing in here . . . you're a man , aren't you ? "  he doesn't reply , but you know he's thinking in his head , " what an odd species of human -- so small .  must be one of those children everyone's been talking about . "  this poor girl , scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb , would later swear off the male gender entirely , just one of the many lesbian conversions he's responsible for .  the movie doesn't focus too closely on webb's romance , it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie , where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of their drills .  after two privates hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea , webb asks owens , " was that flea you killed a male or female ? "  owens replies , " a male , sir . "  webb yells to the platoon , " this ain't the one ! "  that such a scene ( along with the rest of the movie ) was intended to be taken seriously defies comment .  but we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the d . i . , but for iwo jima , guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the 20th century .  webb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie ( with the exception of owens ) were played by actual marines .  someone wanting to parody this movie couldn't do a more comical job than webb did .  it makes it all the more ironic ( like raeeyain on your wedding day ) that the man had no sense of humor himself .  there's a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter .  webb bursts in the room and shouts , " what did i tell you about laughing ? ! "  to which the private replies , " sir , only nine-year-old girls laugh , sir ! "  and let me tell you , i was as happy as a nine-year- old girl while watching this movie .  
sometimes , when i decide to write a short story or a poem , i think of a title first , and then think of a subject to go with it .  it seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence .  i wouldn't be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits , and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it .  the title sequence is so good , so ominous and original , that it had me engrossed before the picture even began .  of course , my attention dwindled shortly into the film .  disturbing behavior , like so many thrillers , starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous .  it's a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex .  it's a suspense film with no suspense .  it's an evil small town story with no story to speak of .  it's a disaster , a listless and uninspired disaster , that just barely misses one-stardom because of a few good sequences , a mercifully short running time , and one terrific set of opening credits .  our main man is a fellow named steve clark , blandly played by jimmy marsden .  he moves to a small town with his family after , tragically , his brother shoots himself .  steve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother ; we learn this through strange home-video like nightmares that he has occasionally .  the big trial for steve is , of course , to fit in at school and make new friends .  marsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail , so he seems a poor casting choice for a social reject .  as a social reject , he falls in with some pretentious dope-smoking philosophers , gavin ( nick stahl ) and rachel ( katie holmes ) .  gavin informs steve that the local group of jocks , known as the blue ribboners , are actually a bunch of zombies , assimilating new members into their group , while sporadically killing innocent people .  so , it's up to our group of mismatched protagonists to 1 ) solve the mystery , and 2 ) do something about it .  by the end of it all , something has happened and things have been explained , but the film still doesn't make any sense .  disturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg .  i've seen his name around recently ( he was one of the toucher-uppers on the armageddon script ) , and i imagine that , for the most part , he knows what he's doing when it comes to screenwriting .  he did , however , have a complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film , and then decided to actually take the time to write it out .  evil small town films are pretty common ( the last one , phantoms , is also a dismal failure ) , but it takes a lot of skill to make the formula work .  rosenberg's script is a complete mess , lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization .  and it makes no sense , nor is their any purpose when things are finally " explained . "  there is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks , but the film never explains exactly what * is * happening .  they get strapped to chairs , a microchip is inserted into their eyes , and -- poof -- they become sex-crazed , superviolent , machine-like creatures .  the doctor responsible for all this , dr . caldicott ( bruce greenwood ) , must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is a step up from the way high school jocks actually behave ( or , perhaps , this is the only realistic element in the film ) .  much of the writing is simply bad , and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act .  in one terrible scene , gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques , while pointing them out in the cafeteria .  up front , i should say that , in four years of high school , i did not eat in the cafeteria even once .  that aside , the various social groups he points out are general , uninteresting , and poorly-shown .  for instance , he points to the " nerds , " who are all wearing glasses and playing with their laptops .  it's such an obvious cliche that i can't believe rosenberg even bothered .  most of the dialogue is forced ( no one says , " bite me ! "  anymore ) , and none of the scenes have any degree of wit .  this picture is not inspired , and most scenes flop from one to the other , with no sense of momentum or energy .  the blame for this can be placed on director david nutter , who apparently likes his films dry .  horror films should at least exploit violence , but this one is shockingly timid .  there are a few good scenes , though , such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum ( this is , however , the most forced scene in the film , for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn ) .  i also liked the school janitor character , played by william sadler .  he has a few lines that are surprisingly thought-provoking .  the acting is largely a waste of talent .  marsden is , as i said , bland ( thought not particularly bad ) .  bruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted .  stahl and holmes both show they have talent , but the direction isn't good enough to hone in on their skills ( stahl's performance seems more like a parody of high school potheads ) .  none of these characters expand beyond their one dimension , and , frankly , watching cardboard cut-outs of human beings run down hallways while screaming just isn't all that cool .  disturbing behavior is a wreck of a film , and it started out a wreck before shooting even began .  i'm surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make a good film , or that it would make a lot of money at the box office .  it's not boring , or even blatantly awful , but it's an uninspired lump of a film .  it sure starts off nicely , but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable .  so , if you go to see this film , take my advice : appreciate the credit sequence , and pray it never ends .  
`the bachelor' is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see .  wading through this gooey , detestable sludge is quite the chore for even a dedicated romantic .  those hoping to find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris o'donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere ; `the bachelor' is a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few brief moments of surprising poignancy .  awaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money .  although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical pretty-boy cocoon , chris o'donnell has an effortless charm as an actor .  most will recognize him as the high-flying robin from the two latest `batman' films , but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile .  can o'donnell carry the weight of a film on his shoulders ?  perhaps , if he found the proper vehicle . . .  but `the bachelor' falls far short of the requirements .  the actor just can't register with such a pathetic screenplay as the guiding light to success .  a few instances of adorable humor aside , it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering mess that is `the bachelor' .  o'donnell plays jimmie , a hopeless romantic in his late twenties who's progressing in a serious relationship with anne ( renee zellweger ) .  jimmie takes anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for proposals , and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage .  the problem is that his proposal sucks .  big time .  you can tell things aren't going pleasantly , because jimmie gets the infamous ? deer-in-the-headlights' look when anne questions his approach .  and then , the plot ( along with the stupidity of the movie ) thickens .  jimmie's grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies suddenly , leaving a video will behind for his grandson ( who also happens to be his only living relative ) .  everybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is passing down an inheritance in the amount of 100 million dollars to jimmie .  of course , there's a catch : he must get married before his 30th birthday , stay joined with his bride for an entire decade , and produce healthy children within the first five years .  the bad news is that jimmie's birthday is the following day .  with anne out of town , he must find a willing bride to share his riches with . . .  and within a very limited time frame .  there are certainly a few worthwhile aspects of `the bachelor' .  for one , the movie's approach is interesting and not dripping with clich ? .  another is the colorful cast .  o'donnell and zellweger are cute together , and the supporting cast tries relentlessly to rescue the film from drowning in it's own mediocrity .  ustinov is enjoyable as the cranky grandfather figure , and james cromwell is sincere and effective as a wise priest dragged through jimmie's marital adventures .  and now the cons : the approach may be interesting , but in trying an old-fashioned method , director gary sinyor gives the film a synthetic feel .  the characters are drawn with obvious , broad strokes , and the plot is bogged down with everything humanly imaginable .  yes , `the bachelor' is far more frustrating than cute .  the screenplay is lamely written , and the subject matter poorly conceived .  the considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted , along with whatever promise the film initially contained .  potential goes out the window early to suit sinyor's `colorful' approach , but not a minute of this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the director's wishes .  `the bachelor' becomes lost without a homing beacon to save it .  you've seen the tv spots , haven't you ?  o'donnell is madly rushing down a deserted street and the caption reads `what is this man running from ? '  in actuality , he's fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to marry him and inherit his fortune ( it's one of the few enjoyable sequences in the film ) .  after seeing the movie , i believe that the approaching horde could be something else .  o'donnell could be running from his angry fans , who have just endured `the bachelor' , and are hunting him down for revenge .  
 " the 44 caliber killer has struck again . "  starring john leguizamo , mira sorvino , adrian brody , jennifer esposito , michael rispoli , bebe neuwirth .  rated r .  summer of sam will be remembered as a waste of spike lee's abilities .  lee is a great filmmaker , often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma and martin scorsese and a storytelling ability comparable to steven spielberg .  but here , he gets himself into a bind .  his latest effort is a case of a director pretending he has something to say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb from his work .  the summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in new york city .  it was the hottest summer on record .  to boot , new york's first serial killer was on the loose : calling himself the son of sam , david berkowitz killed 9 people in the new york area and frightened the whole city population .  so it was understandable that when nyc was hit with a citywide blackout , people went berserk , causing billions of dollars in damage to the city .  the movie's focus is on a group of twenty-somethings during that fateful summer : vinny ( john leguizamo ) , a club-hopping , adultrous hairdresser , his benevolent wife dionna ( mira sorvino , looking young ) , ritchie ( adrian brody ) , a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son of sam suspect , a gang of small time mobsters and a few more minor characters .  we follow them through their roller coaster lives , thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings .  vinny and dionna have marital problems because vinny cheats and dionna tries to please him , make him stay faithful to her .  ritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more and more " eccentric , " and has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his girlfriend .  tensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of son of sam's first murder looms ; the night he promises he will strike again .  a local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects .  at the top of the list is ritchie .  vinny , an unwilling part of the said group , is called upon to set a trap for his friend .  as we watch these proceedings , some of which are painfully graphic , the dreaded " so what ? "  question springs to mind .  from the way this movie is made , i'd have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something , but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find .  lee touches on so much -- the media , the 70's punk scene , the details of the actual killings , as well as the characters' very personal dilemmas -- but he doesn't bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement .  all is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow ; it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable .  too bad summer of sam doesn't get any help here .  frankly , it's a bore , a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that doesn't entertain beyond its first half hour .  there is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague .  leguizamo's turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny .  the script makes it clear that we're supposed to believe that his character is flawed , but still a good guy .  you'd never guess from his performance .  adrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better .  sorvino gives a riveting , touching performance in a banal movie ( i'm tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane ) ; her character is affecting and her emotions true-to-heart .  brody , too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for .  summer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film : it looks great , it has a few notable performances and i suppose it's pretty well directed , in a purely technical way .  but it's also empty , pretentious and boring .  like last year's the thin red line , it's a movie by a director who doesn't know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;  
lauded as a genius by many , stanley kubrick commands a superlative filmography that includes such critically-acclaimed films as " 2001 : a space odyssey , " " a clockwork orange , " " lolita , " and " dr .  strangelove , or : how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb . "  now , sadly , he's added " eyes wide shut " to that impeccable body of work and his final film is the first and only blot on his near-flawless copybook .  kubrick , alas , should have quit while he was ahead .  this much-publicized psycho-sexual tease-a-thon , with its star billing of real-life marrieds tom cruise and nicole kidman , is nothing more than one long ( two-and-a-half hours long ) boring exercise that features kubrick operating with talent wide shut .  kubrick , faithless to arthur schnitzler's 1926 novella " dream story , " has confused eroticism with nudity .  he has confused intellectualism with talking slowly .  he has confused profundity with pretentiousness .  in addition , the director has made some strange casting choices , leaving sydney pollack in and leaving accomplished performers harvey keitel and jennifer jason leigh out .  pollack , the director of such box-office hits as " tootsie " and " out of africa , " is normally solid in his occasional acting stints but here he's miserably out of his depth . . .  and there isn't much depth to begin with !  unhappily , there's not likely to be a director's cut of this film to determine whether the decision to exorcise keitel and leigh was the right one .  in fact , with the exception of the stark black-and-white credits , snatches of baroque music on the soundtrack , and many , many grainy tracking shots down lavishly-decorated corridors , there's none of kubrick's trademark brilliance in this film .  it doesn't help that the story , as delivered , is ridiculous .  cruise and kidman , who bring little more than marital torpor to the project , play well-to-do new yorkers bill and alice harford .  he's a doctor and she's an unemployed art gallery director and they share a central park west address .  at an opulent party hosted by their friend victor ziegler ( pollack ) , alice gets a little tipsy and starts dancing with a jeremy irons-like hungarian , who's singularly determined to get her in the sack .  bill , too , is seen arm-in-arm with a couple of models before he's pulled away to deal with an overdoser .  back home , bill and alice smoke a little pot before alice's aggressive jealousy kicks in .  as retribution , she confesses to her husband that she once had deep feelings for a naval officer she eyeballed at a hotel where she and bill once stayed .  this hurtful admission sends bill into a tailspin ; he pounds the streets of the village in his heavy black overcoat struggling with black-and-white images of alice in the grip of a horny midshipman .  it's all way too much for him .  for revenge , bill almost has sex with a hooker .  he almost has feelings for a underage girl he sees in a costume store .  then he almost does the hooker's roommate .  and he's almost involved in an overblown rococo orgy when an old college chum of his tips him off to a mysterious , password-protected party where everyone wears masks and " the women are incredible " ( i . e . , naked ) .  this " erotic " set piece , a cult-ish bacchanal complete with chanting , incense , and lots of strategically-placed partygoers covering up the dirty , might impress the likes of hugh hefner , but it's a lot less shocking than it's intended to be .  what's the big deal ?  bill doesn't exactly * do * anything ( other than throw his money and credentials around ) , and alice only ever lusted in her heart .  whoop-dee-doo .  still , they make up at the same agonizingly slow pace--was kubrick , notorious for multiple takes , paying them at an hourly rate ?  even geniuses have their bad days .   " eyes wide shut " just happens to be kubrick's bad day , an unerotic , disappointing , and altogether pointless end to an otherwise memorable career .  
in 1990 , the surprise success an unheralded little movie called ghost instantly rescued the moribund careers of its trio of above-the-title stars , patrick swayze , demi moore , and whoopi goldberg .  eight years later , moore and goldberg's careers aren't exactly thriving , but they have had their share of screen successes since ; the same can't be said of swayze , who has just added yet another turkey to his resume with the aptly named black dog .  forget the mortal kombat movies--this trucksploitation flick is the closest the movies has come to video games .  good truck driver jack crews ( swayze ) must drive a cargo of illegal firearms from atlanta to new jersey .  along the way , jack and his crew of three run into a number of obstacles--such as a highway weigh station , evil truckers , and deadly uzi-firing motorcyclists .  every so often , like at the end of a video game " level " or " stage , " the main baddie pops up : red ( meat loaf , fresh from the triumph of spice world ) , who wants to steal the cache of guns .  just in case you forget his name or have trouble keeping track of who's driving what , all of red's vehicles , be it a pickup or a big rig , are painted--you guessed it--red .  i could go into more of the plot specifics ( such as jack's dream of having a nice home with his family , the past trauma that sent him to prison and cost him his trucking license , the fbi/atf crew tracking the cargo ) , but they are of little importance .  all that matters to director kevin hooks and writers william mickelberry and dan vining are the obstacles jack confronts in his drive from point a to point b . but they fail at even this modest goal , for none of the highway chaos , as credibly staged as it is , is terribly interesting , let alone exciting .  once you've seen a couple of trucks bang against each other or a big rig explode the first time , you've seen it every time .  as dreary as black dog is as an entertainment , the saddest part about the film has nothing to do with what shows up onscreen ; it's that swayze has to reduce himself to such work .  while far from the best of actors , he is certainly not horrible , and he is a charismatic presence .  i don't know if it's his judgment or the dearth of quality job offers that leads him to involve himself with bombs such as black dog .  regardless , if he continues on this career track , could a tv series be far behind ?  
my first press screening of 1998 and already i've gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list .  what an auspicious beginning !  welcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l . a . and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere .  firestorm , the directorial debut of dances with wolves's academy award winning cinematographer dean semler , is the first of the new year's crop of movies .  as our story opens , the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are " smokejumpers . "  we then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl , where one of the gung-ho guys is taking a romance quiz from " cosmopolitan . "  having the time of their lives , they then jump into the middle of a burning forest .  when , even in the beginning , the director can't get the small parts right , you can sense the movie is in trouble .  with the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline-filled cars , smokejumper monica ( christianne hirt ) tells them to get away from their soon-to-explode vehicles .  not bothering to shout nor even get close to them , she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people .  miraculously , they manage to hear her and move away .  in a movie that specializes in cheap shots , the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building .  as it does throughout , overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f . windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl's face .  our show's two heroes , the crew's chief , wynt perkins , played laconically by scott glenn , and his second-in-command , jesse graves , played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal , enter the burning house looking for the little girl .  in a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames .  the manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse .  this mawkish show cuts back to monica , who has a life-or-death decision to make .  the chopper with the fire-retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group .  will it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monica's two firefighting buddies ?  she has only seconds to decide who will be saved .  yes , she goes for the majority , but , miracle of miracles , the other three come out alive anyway .  not content with a traditional firefighting story , chris soth's screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape .   ( " hoods in the woods , " is what the " ground-pounders " yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire . )  along the way , shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis , who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father , who was a marine drill instructor .  most of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing .  he flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck .  arguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside .  using a ramp , he shoots straight out of the top of the building's attic , and when he hits the ground , he just rides off in a cloud of dust .  when the film isn't using some stock footage of actual forest fires , the simulated ones look hokey .  editor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions .  the ending , with its sick twists , manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie .  perhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby , " it's not as bad as some of the television sitcoms . "  firestorm runs mercifully just 1 : 29 .  it is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers .  
man , this was one wierd movie .  similar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn't decide which genre it is .  the first hour is your standard stock aliens clone , which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship .  the last half hour ?  this was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided - " screw it , let's just kill everybody " .  from then on - forget sci-fi . . . this  movie becomes 100% horror .  what really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way .  instead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare - this movie just uses loud noises , sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore . . . . . yawn . . . . everyone's  seen it all before and knows when to expect it .  the one thing that was done well was the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew .  there are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed , but what did this ?  then finally after being painfully restored - the new crew views the video .  the acting isn't too bad at all . . . . . considering what the actors had to work with anyway , as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of .  there was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though , like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space .  this movie could have been so much better .  it had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with .  there was just nothing new here that any of us haven't seen before in aliens or hellraiser .  
the most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the film does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes .  alas , it refers to our heroes !  as it turns out , the alien race that sends a computer virus to earth ( via the mir space station ) thinks of the human race as a virus -- perhaps even a cancer -- that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any further .  after all , we have taken up this entire planet , and if they let us live for another billion years or so , we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one .  but the human race doesn't have much to worry about .  after all , there's a woman named foster ( jamie lee curtis ) out there stopping the computer virus .  she's the chief navigator on a sea vessel ; travelling with her is captain everton ( donald sutherland ) , steve baker ( william baldwin ) , woods ( marshall bell ) , squeaky ( julio oscar mechoso ) , and richie ( sherman augustus ) .  they're all sailing in a typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous , abandoned russian satellite ship in international waters .  lucky for us , we already saw that the computer virus has taken over the ship and eliminated everyone on board .  the evil captain everton thinks he's going to take the ship in and get a reward ; he convinces his crew that there's going to be big money , so they try to salvage the ship .  soon , however , when it's apparent that no one is on board and that the ship has no power , they realize that something bad must have happened .  finally , they meet nadia ( joanna pacula ) who explains their situation : a computer virus has taken over the ship !  it's creating bio-mechanical life-forms to eliminate the human race !  virus is a truly dumb action thriller , one of negligible intelligence and innovation .  when considering the entire film , you will realize that it lacks a single original scene .  it's a direct rip-off of nearly every james cameron film ( aliens , the abyss , and the terminator films are the most plagiarized ) ; more importantly , it's basically the same movie as last year's deep rising .  i liked deep rising simply because it's funny -- it knows it's silly and derivative .  virus takes itself seriously .  and , in the most serious manner possible , it steals from every good and bad film of the genre , showing you countless familiar scenes , and sporting a cookie-cutter plot that any film of the sci-fi/horror genre could fit with a little trimming .  but what is so amazing about virus is how poorly the whole thing has been thought out .  okay , let me get this straight -- the alien race ( which is never really explained ) is basically sentient electricity .  they need to make themselves physical , so they use a space station to get onto a ship ( which is surrounded by water , but who cares about that ) .  on the ship , they make a bunch of clunky , immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people .  after that , they start using the dead people to create half-human , half-machine creatures that look like the terminator but are much worse at walking around .  the leader , of course , is a big creature .  every film like this has a big creature at the end , but the big creature in virus is so big that it has to tear down the walls to move around .  virus is indeed a cliched film , but the central flaw lies in the fact that the computer virus just isn't very threatening .  it's established that they can simply turn off the power to stop it , but the virus has sealed the power room by the time our heroes get there .  on one level , virus is almost passable fun .  it's really gory , and a few of the scenes have interesting camp appeal ( the director , john bruno , worked on a lot of cameron's films ) .  there's also a nice array of actors , even though none of them do any acting ( except for donald sutherland , who does a lot of very bad acting ) .  the bottom line , however , is this : virus is a bad movie .  it rips off a lot of good movies that are worth seeing .  in that order , i recommend that you rent any one of the alien films , simply to admire the qualities of a creature that actually threatens our heroes .  
contrary to popular belief , not every single foregin film released to an american market is a masterpiece .  some of them aren't even good .  some examples of this principle are the aboslutely dreadful " un indien dans la ville " ( presented as " little indian , big city , " and remade into that crap tim allen flick , " jungle2jungle " ) , and this .  what could have been a clever little sex comedy turns into one mess of a french flick .   " french twist " ( the " cool " american title , not the real one , which was " gazon maudit , " literally meaning " twisted ground , " or something like that ) deals with a married couple with kids , and the intrusion of a stranger who kinda screws things up for them .  loli and alain chabat ( victoria abril and alain chabat ) are not exactly happily married .  always on business trips , alain chabat more than once cheats on her , and she eventually finds out .  and one day , she meets a butch mechanic , marijo ( the co-writer/director josiane balasko ) , and they two kinda hit it off .  so she decides she will get back at alain chabat by doing the obvious : sleeping with marijo .  but she soons starts to not only fall in love with marijo , but she's also realizes she's still in love with alain chabat .  so , of course , she does the obvious from that : she decides to keep them both .  she'll be ( and sleep ) with each of them for 3 days each , then on sunday , she'll rest by herself .  after all , she needs it if she's gonna have more sex than sylvia kristel .  the film goes on for over an hour and a half , through stupidity after stupidity , moronic twist after moronic twist , and soon there's the little ironic ( ! ! ! )  ending .  i know it's a completely different culture , and i'm quite familiar with the french and their cinema , but this is just bad .  none of the characters are more intelligent than peter stormare in " fargo " ( a movie where stupid characters were backed up to make a point ) , and any action they do is pretty much just to get a hopeful chuckle from the audience .  what's shocking is this was not only one of france's biggest hits , but it was nominated for a lot of cesars ( french equivalent of oscars ) .  the writing and directing is really the big problem with it .  josiane balasko does a good acting job with her role , but her little sex comedy isn't very humerous , entertaining , or even deep at all .  even woody allen's not-very-good " a midsummer night's sex comedy " is intelligent , well-written , and possesses some depth .  this is shallow , unfunny , and pretty annoying to watch .  the film moves at the pace of a snail , and is damn-near painful to watch .  thank god for the fast forward button .  the acting , however , isn't bad at all .  the actors do the best they can with the bad material , and victoria abril is pretty likable despite the script ( and the fact that she's stupid enough to try to divide herself over two people when she has kids ) .  and alain chabat has some funny moments as the neurotic husband .  but " french twist " is just pretty lame .  it's not overly horrible , and has a couple very , very , very brief moments .  but it's just a really crap film , and an example of an ill-advised distribution of a foreign film .  
 " come on , silent bob !  we're going to hollywood . "  starring jason mewes , kevin smith , will ferrell , shannon elizabeth , seann william scott , chris rock , jason lee , ben affleck .  directed by kevin smith .  rated r .  jay and silent bob strike back is a dumb movie disguised in a smarmy interior .  kevin smith , coming off the wonderful , challenging dogma , fills it with sub-road trip gross-out jokes and expects us to buy it because he's just oh-so-ironic .  but when a movie is so self-aware it becomes about nothing but itself , we can hardly be expected to pay for admission .  jay and silent bob , two new jersey stoners who hang out at the doorstep of convenience store selling pot , have appeared in almost all of smith's movies but , if i'm not mistaken , have not starred in one until now .  they find out that there is a movie based on the comic book that is based on them being made in hollywood .  this presents two problems : a ) they haven't received a penny in royalties and b ) nerds on the internet ( " what's the internet ? " )  are talking trash about them .  what is there to do except go to hollywood and stop this movie from being made ?  on the way -- they're hitchhiking , because who knew you needed tickets to take a bus ?  -- they run into a group of hotties who pretend to be with an animal-rights group , but are really jewel thiefs who parade around in charlie's angels-style outfits .  of course , they set jay and silent bob up to look like the thieves , so that there is a massive manhunt going on during the second half of the film .  will ferrell , who again proves himself incapable of doing anything but sketch comedy , shows up as the wildlife marshal inspector who thinks the two have stolen a monkey .  the movie will probably please only smith's die-hard , undiscerning fans ; everyone else will be critical of this mind-bogglingly stupid effort following some the sophisticated cinema that he churned out in years past .  any appeal the movie has will come from the " in " jokes , most of which i think i understood , but the movie is " in " to the point of absurdity .  there needs to be something holding it together other than its own smugness .  once jay and silent bob get to hollywood , the movie abruptly switches gears from gross-out comedy to ridiculously broad hollywood satire .  countless " hot " movie stars and personalities make an appearance , from smith veterans matt damon and ben affleck to wes craven , but jay and silent bob strike back resorts to such low-brow gags as another scream sequel with a monkey as the killer .  get it ?  they're so desperate for another movie , they ran out of ideas and used a monkey !  a monkey !  as often happens with writers who are working below what they are actually capable of , most of the really good lines are throwaways , while the big , painstaking gags mostly fall flat .  one of the funniest lines in the movie flies by : when asked to comment on the clitoris ( don't ask ) , jay responds : " the female clitoris ? "  kevin smith is a talented writer ( though i agree that his films would be better off if he'd let a real director take the helm ) , and jay and silent bob strike back holds true to his promise to make a more facetious film .  unfortunately , it's also shapeless , pointless and largely unfunny .  smith's " verbal trampoline , " as ben affleck once called his distinctive dialogue , takes a back seat to his dubious instincts as a populist filmmaker .  this was supposed to be the movie that didn't offend anyone , but it's offensive because it's terrible .  
 " saving silverman " is a good example of a good comedy gone bad .  as a love story it is good , however as a comedy it falls flat on it's face .  i think throughout the short 90 minutes i laughed a total of seven times . . . and  those were just chuckles at the most !  the movie doesn't have the oomph to make it a great movie , and doesn't have the script to make it a funny movie .  wayne lefessier ( steven zahn ) , j . d . mcnugent ( jack black ) , and darren silverman ( jason biggs ) have grown up all their lives together , they have been best friends forever and vow to stay close till the end .  while in a bar after doing a show with their band , based on their love of neil diamond , darren meets a young woman named judith ( amanda peet ) whom he instantly falls for .  wayne and j . d . however think differently and when judith tells darren that he can never see his friends again , it's up to wayne and j . d . to try and begin saving silverman .  the performances are topnotch and surprisingly , they are what keep the movie afloat .  jason biggs right off the flop " loser " does an ok job playing silverman , but he is stale and flat at times .  steve zahn is perfect in the role of wayne lefessier , and even though the movie is about silverman , lefessier is really the main character and the narrator of the movie itself .  jack black is well jack black , and he does an all right job as j . d . but he isn't as funny as he has been in the past .  amanda peet plays the ultimate bitch as judith , and neil diamond plays neil diamond ( he's better at singing than acting ) .  anyway the performances in the film are good , but it's too bad the script isn't .  speaking of script , hank nelkan's choppy script is not only badly written , but not funny enough even for an episode of sesame street .  the trailer for the movie , as with most movies gives away everything that happens in the movie , especially the funniest parts .  somewhere " saving silverman " was meant to be a good movie , and it could have been , but alas in the end it wasn't .  dennis dugan's direction is all right , he adds a few directorial touches here and there , nothing special being a simple comedy .   " saving silverman " is a perfectly bad movie in more ways than one .  it has a great cast , a good director and a sweet story . . . it's  just too bad it has a bad script and is all together a bad movie .  
capsule : an insult .  a stupid and incompetent movie that doesn't even have the benefit of being trashily enjoyable .  weslely and woody would do well to leave this off their resumes .  money train is one of the worst movies i have ever seen .  it's not simply idiotic , it's contemptuous of its audience .  it tries to make us swallow things that a better movie would be stopped cold by or just plain omit entirely .  it's a waste of wesley snipes and woody harrelson , who are enjoyable actors in their own rights but are nauseating here .  it's not even fun as trash .  woody and wesley star ( maybe that's not the right word ) as new york city transit authority police .  they have a job which could actually be the core of a really interesting movie : one of them plays drunk possum to attract chain-snatchers and the other does lookout .  i had a whole headful of legal and ethical questions surrounding this , raised by a documentary i'd seen on the subject once , but the movie does not waste any time with being intelligent or thought-provoking .  see if you can follow this .  they chase a kid down the tunnel and into the station where the " money train " , the heavily armored car that picks up all the cash from the token books , is parked .  the guards on the train see this kid running at them , lift their machine guns , shout " halt ! "  and then open fire when the kid doesn't stop running at them .  blam , the kid's dead .  then woody and wesley show up , and of course the other ta cops hate them ( why ? ) , and a pushing match starts , and someone gets decked , and . . . i covered my face .  i'd seen enough .  i've never seen a movie work so hard and in so little time to destroy , systematically , any chance of being credible or interesting .  fed up with the bs at their job ( most of it their own goddamned fault ) , woody and wesley hatch this plot about how to rob the money train .  hence the title , in case some of you ( all two of you ) didn't figure it out yet .  then there's this subplot about a maniac who torches token book clerks , * and * a love story , * and * a holdup -- no , two holdups , sorry , easy to lose track in a movie this braindead -- * and * a mob boss who wants his money .  there wasn't a minute when i gave a horse's ass about any of it .  neither woody nor wesley play characters that are interesting for a single minute .  we do not care about them .  they are not interesting .  they are noisy , loud , stupid , foolish jerks who whould have flunked out of the police academy .  they deserve to get shot -- or run over , as the case may be .  they only exist to rehash the kind of dynamics that was * written * into a movie like white men can't jump , and which simply does not exist here .  they are idiots , and we're expected to root for them .  bullcrap .  the movie is completely schizophrenic in its tone and texture .  what exactly is this mess ?  a cop movie ?  police procedure is not given a moment's genuine thought anywhere .  a thriller ?  the subplot with the token booth killer is inept , a throwaway that should have been ditched in the rewrite .  a comedy ?  the few jokes that do work are wasted .  a drama ?  all dramatic tension between both principals is freeze-dried and off-the-rack .  there's not a moment in the movie where i felt like i was listening to genuine human beings talk ; it's all screenwriterese , that bizarre analect where every sentence ends in a punchline and the primary mode of expression is the unique conjunctions of four-letter words .   ( actual dialogue excerpt : " fuck you . "   " what ? "   " you heard me : fuck * you * . "   " no : fuck * you * ! " )  look . i'll be honest here .  i've tried writing screenplays , and even * i * suspect that if i tried to pitch this mess , i'd get laughed out of the office .  anyone interested in hearing my ideas for a few good movies can write me and hear my pitch , because god knows i know i can do better .  i've weasted enough time on this piece of tripe .  
there is a rule when it comes to movies .  a sequel is never as good as the original .  there are very few exceptions to this rule , and texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation is not one of them .  now if you also take into consideration that the original chainsaw massacre was a really bad movie , and that this isn't even the first sequel to it , you have a recipe for a very painful viewing experience .  don't be fooled by the presence of up and coming talents matthew mcconaughey ( a time to kill ) and renee zellweger ( jerry maguire ) .  they made this movie before they were stars .  judging by their performances they also made it before they took any acting lessons .  it's a wonder they ever worked in hollywood again after appearing in this turkey .  apparently the producers of this film realized just how bad it was , because it sat unreleased for years until someone decided that they might be able to capitalize off the success of mcconaughey and zellweger .  apparently the two young stars were none too happy about this thing ever seeing the light of day .  and i don't blame them , they would have been better off if this had been some sort of porno flick starring the two of them .  unfortunately for them it is a horror film in which zellweger plays your typically stupid horror film character .  while mcconaughey plays a guy who wears a mechanical brace on his leg that he controls with a television remote control .   ( hey , don't say i didn't warn you . )  to make matters worse , leatherface , the chainsaw wielding maniac , who was never the scariest of psychopathic killers at the best of times , has now become a full blown cross-dresser , and spends the entire movie in drag .  there is a plot to this movie but it isn't worth mentioning .  let's just suffice to say that a group of teenagers are in the typical wrong place at the wrong time and are left to the mercy of remote control man ( mcconaughey ) and his lipstick wearing chainsaw revving half-witted sidekick .  man , i can't get over just how bad this movie is .  this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities .  even the obligatory topless babe shot wasn't enough to hold my interest for more than 2 seconds .  the writing is bad , the direction is even worse , but both of those things look good in comparison to the acting .  this is the sort of movie that they should make people in prison watch .  a guarantee you , if criminals thought that they would be subjected to this film they would never break the law again .  
mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival .  as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival .  it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time .  in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry .  toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart .  the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it .  something else is what he did .  the film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life .  she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep .  meanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada .  she wants to build a career as an actress .  betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow .  she does not know who the woman is .  she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is .  they fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not .  meanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own .  he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george ) .  these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong .  there is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion .  in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits .  a lot of mulholland drive starts out fun .  lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film .  he just chooses not to .  as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason .  there are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches .  the film is a little long for the subject matter .  toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot .  unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers .  i will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  mulholland drive spoiler warning .  i have rated this film fairly low .  you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film .  david lynch is in large part a dark satirist .  most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside .  in mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre .  what he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? )  playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on .  the first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout .  then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something .  the audience expectation is that they will add up .  but he has given clues that are self-contradictory .  lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories .  in fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke .  there is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties .  mad magazine called it a poiuyt .  other sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar .  look at small portions of it and makes sense .  look at the whole figure and it does not .  this film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar .  
one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean-luc godard film .  after all , he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave .  he is also an esteemed film critic , lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing .  however , his latest creation , in praise of love , is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year .  the abstract concept on which the film is based had merit , to dissect love into the following four categories : meeting , physical passion , quarrels , and reconciliation .  these four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples : young , adult , and elderly .  it is edgar's ( bruno putzulu ) self-appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup , to define a central idea : " it's only when things are over that they make sense . "  whether this project will end up a play , film , or opera remains undecided .  the thesis is simple enough that , if played right , it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone .  instead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes , the next scene no more engaging than the last .  only once does any character utter something worthwhile , but by the time it happens you're so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it .  but don't fret , it will surface again .  you could easily sleep through whole sections of the film ( as some fellow critics did ) and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in , not having missed anything worthwhile .  but you hold hope for some time .  the background music keeps you in a state of urgency , and even suspense , for the first few conversations .  it's only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope .  and with speeches like , " i am thinking of something , but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else , " how can you expect to hold anyone's interest ?  to godard's credit , he certainly knows how to frame a scene .  the black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful .  watching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him .  and if this film had anything poignant to say , you would have , which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities .  the environments , be it city or country , are impeccably captured in crisp detail , but the script never complements them .  unfortunately , godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene .  sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings , but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words .  the second half is composed of nauseating hyper-color that often blurs the image .  you suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners .  the only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies .  steven spielberg is picked on in particular .  while i'll grant that this does happen , and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage , it's still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood .  it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller .  the days of breathless are no more .  
i am continually amazed at movies like this .  that some producer would waste an abundance of talent and money on a script as abysmal as this one is mind-boggeling , but it seems to happen a lot nowadays .   " wild wild west " is a beautifully filmed , well acted , and well directed piece of garbage ; and its insipid screenplay is completely at fault .  in short , this movie is a comedy without laughs .  so many jokes fall flat that it borderlines surreal .  the high production values keep it from being a total fiasco , but it's still pretty boring .  will smith stars as jim west , an old western , r&b variation of the james bond character .  west is teamed up with artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , and they're pretty much polar oppisites : west prefers to solve his problems with an array of bullets , gordon traditionally favors a more pacifistic approach .  talk about deeply developed characters .  at any rate , this leads to the inevitable conflicts between methodologies , none of which are funny .  the year is 1869 .  several top scientists have been abducted , and the suspected culprit is a disgruntled former confederate general , bloodbath mcgrath ( ted levine ) .  president grant sends west and gordon to investigate .  there's evidence that mcgrath is attending some sort of confederate reunion in louisiana .  west and gordon show up and learn that mcgrath is actually working for dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , another disgruntled former confederate .  as it turns out , loveless plans to use the combined knowledge of the scientests to create the ultimate super weapon , which he will use to conquer the united states .  i'd go further with the plot , but there isn't any point .  this film's narrative is little more than a jumbled , unfunny mess .  i only laughed at a couple of jokes , and then only lightly .  there isn't one truly uprorously funny moment in this film , and that's pretty disasterous when you consider that it's primarily a comedy .  as i said , the fault is totally that of the script .  when you consider their respective roles , will smith and kevil kline do as good as they could have possibly done .  the leads could've been played samuel l . jackson and robert de niro and the film still would've been awful .  no one , and i mean no one , can make a line like " bye bye , mr . knife guy ! "  sound good .  still , this film has a lot going for it visually .  the set design is fantastic , maybe even oscar worthy .  the cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus ( who was also behind camera in martin scorsese's brilliant " goodfellas " ) , is absolutely stunning .  he lends the film a much needed exciting , comic bookish look .  i won't fault barry sonnenfeld either .  he does a fine job of directing the proceedings , but , like the rest of the people involved with the film , there really isn't anything that he can do to correct its one major flaw .  despite being beautifully made , " wild wild west " becomes quite boring after the half-way point .  the appeal of the visuals ends long before the film does .  if " wild wild west " didn't look so good , it would be almost insufferable .  as it is , it's somewhat tolerable , but not very entertaining .  it hurts to give such a well made movie a score this low , but there isn't anything much worse than an unfunny comedy .  
synopsis : when a meteorite crashlands in the arizona desert , community college professors ira kane ( duchovny ) and harry block ( jones ) are first on the scene .  they discover that an alien lifeform has arisen from the rock and is evolving at an amazing rate .  soon the army , advised by dr allison reed ( moore ) , moves in and forces kane and block out .  but when the aliens begin to menace society , it may take the scientists' combined efforts to stop them before they terminate the evolution of another lifeform : humanity .  review : " evolution " certainly has the ingredients for a decent comedy .  it's directed by reitman , clearly trying to parlay his " ghostbusters " success into a twenty-first-century counterpart .  it stars duchovny , and although one might question his judgment in lampooning his " x-files " character so soon after leaving the tv series , it should certainly provide him with plenty of ammunition .  and then there's moore , who may not have much prior experience in comedy , but who has certainly proven her ability as an actress .  a shame , then , that it all deteriorates into such a hopelessly unfunny morass .   " evolution " is a movie more concerned with its special effects ( which are quite good ) than anything resembling a consistently funny script .  it has its moments ( a scene in which jones' body is invaded by an alien is particularly entertaining ) , but there are embarrassingly long stretches that are utterly devoid of humour .  moore is totally wasted , her clumsy shtick getting very old , very fast .  duchovny has stunningly little in the way of material to work with .  and the story is so formulaic , it could have been written by monkeys .  part of what made " ghostbusters " so wonderful was a combination of a great script and characters the audience could root for .   " evolution " is so mind-numbingly tedious that it's difficult not to start cheering for the aliens .  
michael crichton has had a long career of writing novels , many of which are science fiction .  the most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of a michael crichton science fiction novel .  so in the logic of the film industry a good way to make a profitable film would be to make a big-budget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel .  congo failed , and i am afraid that sphere is probably not going to fare a whole lot better .  it a little better than just okay novel and it makes a film that is not even that good .  the film is expensive , over one hundred million dollars ; is long , 133 minutes ; has a terrific cast , including dustin hoffman , samuel l . jackson , and sharon stone ; but has little that is really original and less that is exciting .  several years ago dr . norman goodman ( played by dustin hoffman ) was asked to write up a set of procedures for the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered .  the plan he wrote was only semi-serious , but did explicitly define a team of experts who should investigate the alien .  now that team has been assembled by a mysterious team leader named barnes ( peter coyote ) to study a spacecraft almost a half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early 1700s .  suddenly norman's less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing with a real alien spacecraft .  included in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , and astrophysicist ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) .  together they travel to the deep pacific spaceship to understand its secrets .  one major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of gold-toned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship .  what is disappointing about this film is that it does not have really effective performances .  director barry levinson is at his best with good actors rather than good special effects .  the problem here is he is making a big-budget science fiction film .  it has some effects , but the most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on a radar screen .  the technique is to suggest rather than to show and let the actors and the viewer's imagination carry the film as robert wise did with the haunting .  that could be a reasonable approach in a low-budget film .  but that requires creating much more atmosphere than levinson can manage to muster .  it requires the actors to give really compelling performances and simply put , they don't .  hoffman's acting seems muted .  jackson seems to laid back .  we do not feel for these characters and do not get inside their heads .  levinson paid big bucks for his actors and does not really get price performance .  and why we have queen latifah as a minor functionary on the expedition is anybody's guess . a  cast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at a fraction of the price .  look how much more powerful a film like alien was with only moderate actors .  most science fiction spectaculars these days have second-tier actors and first-tier special effects .  levinson tries second-tier effects , and first-tier actors , but never makes that exchange pay off for the viewer .  perhaps sci-fi spectaculars are just not an actor's medium .  the result gets a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  
 " goodbye , lover " sat on the shelf for almost a year since its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival last may , and one look will tell you why .  it's a mess .  and that's * way * before ellen degeneres shows up .  the film is one of those torrid double-indemnity crime stories that , in this case , required the services of three screenwriters .  i suspect that one wrote a sexy thriller , one wrote a murder mystery , and one wrote a comedy , then director roland joff ? tried to piece it all together in the editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment .  i didn't laugh at ellen degeneres much ( i think i was supposed to ) .  degeneres is horrible and her character is even worse , a tough-talking vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe and bad hair .  either degeneres is wearing a wig--as most of the actors appear to be--or she doesn't yet have enough clout to secure a hairstylist .  every single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy and hip , but her incessant wisecracking is poorly-written and merely stupid .  her reaction to the brutal killing of a jogger is " at least she died healthy . "  and that's one of her wittier asides .  degeneres' sgt .  rita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedly accidental death of . . . wait .  to give away too much of the plot would all but ruin a film that has very little going for it outside of its numbing plot twists and multiple triple-crosses .  it's best described this way :  sultry sexpot/real estate agent sandra dunmore ( patricia arquette ) is married to jake , a " creative yet unfocused " ( and alcoholic ) advertising rep , played by dermot mulroney .  sandra likes to act out her deep-seated sexual fantasies and jake's brother ben ( the suave-as-ever don johnson ) likes to help .  ben is also coming on to his petite , mousy co-worker peggy blaine ( mary-louise parker ) and someone , somewhere , is planning to cash in on that huge life insurance policy of his .  the film is ripe with cheating lovers cheating on each other and back again .  although there are some genuine surprises , the plot twists get too contrived too quickly .  probably around the time degeneres' gumcracking gumshoe appears .  at least the former " ellen " star is going for something a little different .  arquette turns in yet another of her stiletto-heeled , platinum blonde bombshell roles ( see : " lost highway , " " true romance " ) while quoting embarrassing lines like " i'm not wearing any underwear . "  i hope she got paid a lot of money to do this .  here's an example of some of the film's flat-out stupidity .  sandra purchases a used car and disguises herself in a red wig prior to stalking two of the film's duplicitous lovers .  she drives the motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite " the sound of music " on her car stereo , intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims .  so what was the point of the wig and the car ?   " the sound of music " stuff might be a reference to " the wizard of oz " allusions in david lynch's " wild at heart , " but if so joff ? must have forgotten that " wild at heart " was a despicable movie .  it's hard to believe that " goodbye , lover " was directed by the same person who made " the killing fields " and " the mission . "  it's not , however , hard to see why it sat on the shelf for so long .  it should have stayed there .  
of course i knew this going in .  why is it that whenever a tv-star makes a movie it's always a romantic comedy , and then they say on entertainment tonight or something , that they were " attracted to the characters .  they were really original . "  original ? ! let me give you a run-through of picture perfect : character a ) kate ( jennifer aniston , from tv's friends ) , a smart , beautiful , professional woman wants two things she can't have : a new job-title and the love of her co-worker kevin bacon .  her boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a german sportscar , and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls .  what does she do ?  she invents a fiance !  then when everyone wants to meet him , she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him $1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner , and pick a fight with her at the end , thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job , since the guy ends up looking like a jerk and she is the poor , defenceless female .  he , of course , goes along with it .  gee , i wonder if they get together in the end .  i've seen more original stuff on the wb .  and better stuff too .  picture perfect also makes the mistake of being _wayyyyy_ too long at 100 minutes , and expecting us to like aniston's character , who comes off as a cold , spoiled bitch .  
i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick .  take the professional , for example .  it boasts extremely glossy cinematography , a couple of recognizable name actors , and a couple of fairly impressive explosions .  it's also basically about violence and cheap titilation , and features a central relationship between a middle-aged man and a twelve-year-old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension .  the professional is all over the map , and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant .  the professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon ( jean reno ) , brutally efficient but also very isolated .  one day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door .  her name is matilda ( natalie portman ) , and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d . e . a .  agent norman stansfield ( gary oldman ) after matilda's father tried to rip him off .  leon reluctantly takes matilda in , then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother .  the two become closer , which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much , and sets out to eliminate them both .  writer/director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita , a slick potboiler about a female assassin .  there is no question that besson can make a great * looking * film ; with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast , he has created a film chock full of moody close-ups and evocative lighting .  but beneath the shiny wrapper , there isn't nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe .  the relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop .  leon is mostly a collection of quirky traits , all intended to show us that for a hired killer , he's really not so bad a guy : he drinks lots of milk , takes meticulous care of a potted plant , and enjoys gene kelly movies .  jean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality , but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda .  natalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality , but she doesn't have too much to work with , either .  besson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life , and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing .  a silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place , as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover ; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag .  gary oldman's entire part is something of a cheap gag , wild-eyed and way over the top , but at least he is interesting to watch .  there isn't a real person to be found anywhere in the professional , which isn't always a problem in an action thriller , except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more .  a more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelve-year-old in a really distasteful way .  there were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matilda's relationship : confront it head on , or ignore it entirely .  but besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he's going to show them a forbidden love story , while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman's rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing .  this is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol , or the blood which is spilled aplenty .  a great deal of the time , the professional is just plain sleazy , and all the soft filters in the world can't disguise that fact .  
these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes .  but , only a few years ago , before wes craven publicly made fun of the practice , sequels had been more popular among hollywood producers .  sequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south .  the way to regain popularity and prestige , they thought , was the use the same formulas , characters and story lines that brought them success in the first place .  one of such celebrity was eddie murphy , black comedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline during the first part of this decade .  in order to return to the spotlight , he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film , beverly hills cop , 1984 action comedy that had already spawned the sequel in 1987 .  seven years later , for the third instalment , he used the directorial service of john landis , another fading star , with whom he successfully collaborated twice - in trading places and coming to america .  this time , however , third time wasn't the charm and beverly hills iii was failure .  eddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback .  eddie murphy here plays axel foley , fast-talking streetwise detroit policeman , who raids illegal chop shop .  the routine police action ends in tragedy , when the criminals kill foley's boss .  determined to bring the killers to justice , foley realises that their leader is ellis de wald ( timothy carhart ) .  when it turns out that de wald happens to be security chief for wonderland theme park in los angeles , foley goes back to los angeles .  there , with the help of his old friend , local policeman rosewood ( judge rheinhold ) , foley would clash with money counterfeit ring .  ten years has passed since the original and times are definitely different .  in this decade , the contrast between blue collar detroit and yuppie beverly hills , which provided a lot of gags in 1984 film , simply doesn't work .  screenwriter steven e . de souza provides another conflict , this time between the childish sillyness of the good guys and business-like professionalism of the bad guys .  since foley belongs to the former , his character had to watch his language , and the tone of the film in general is more infantile .  unfortunately , this film still belongs to action movie genre , and there is too much violence for little children .  nice example is the humorous scene in the beginning , which turns into standard ramboesque bloodbath .  unlike donner with the lethal weapon series , landis simply can't balance the comedy with " regular " action , and the result is a film that fails in both aspects .  action scenes are sometimes interesting , but not too spectacular ( at the end , scenery of wonderland is more fascinating than the action itself ) ; humour , on the other hand , falls flat .  to make even worse , some minor characters from 1984 film gets unnecessary and sometimes irritating overexposure ( especially art expert turned into arms dealer , played by bronson pinchot ) .  in the end , although the film provided some entertainment , viewers , at least critical ones , would probably be happy to know that there aren't any plans for beverly hills iv .  
i have never seen a man so in love with himself than george lucas .  with the overt success of the three original star wars films , lucas has become , not necessarily a filmmaker , but the head cheeze at a huge toy company , with the phantom menace the new product on the shelve .  only this toy was made for $115 million , but every kid wants it , and , like all other expensive toys , falls apart within an hour after playing with it .  the product in question , star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace ( jeez ! ) , is pure and simple : its about the money , baby !  no one in their right mind would create such a fiasco if they knew it wouldn't make a ton of money before its fourth week of release .  i come to the sw franchise as a stranger , since i have absolutely no idea why the sw movies are so popular .  i find them rather boring and full of nothing but eye candy .  phantom menace is like the first sw , minus 10 .  nothing in the whole concept is remotely enjoyable .  even the special effects seem rather bland .  the story in this new one is a mindless mess . . . the  acting wooden . . . and the action sequences like something out of a video game .  sw : phantom menace is one of the worst films of the year so far .  with a title like sw e1 : tpm , lucas has one big head on those shoulders .  i thought chris carter did for releasing an x-files movie , although , that movie adaptation was an excellent way to spend two hours .  pm is one long headache .  
some movies i should just skip .  my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program .  true , the probgram is only 15 years old this time , and it's a cartoon .  but it's a cartoon i liked , and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen .  but my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could it be ?  turns out i was right , mostly .  inspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive-talking side-kick .  at first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver .  this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where " formula " isn't just business , it's a way of life .  the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits .  in some parts you can just hear them saying " more zany !  i want more zany here -- and -- here . "   " let's have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here -- make it really painful .  i want the audience squirming in their seats . "   " ok , that's fine , but i want you to add bug guts . "   " what does this scene do ?  character depth ?  but where's the zaniness ?  i don't see zany here .  if you can't make it zany , cut it ! "  the latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie .  michelle ( who plays penny , gadget's niece ) shines in every scene she's in , but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time .  my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor .  dabney coleman's comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby .  i kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film , but instead , he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes .  he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the " gidget bitch from hell " town mayor .  oteri's overly enthusiastic and continually self-congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland , oregon's own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasn't poking fun at our fair town .  or , maybe all career politicians are like that .  i must say , matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla .  he appears to have some fun with the film , especially as the evil gadget .  rupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw .  joely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself .  her performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film .  d . l . hughley plays the shuckin'-and-jivin' vehicular side-kick , in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years .  the dialog is . . . let's face it , it's pretty bad .  the tag-line after a major set-piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context .  a lot of the lines ( especially hughley's ) appear to be made up as they go along , by people with little gift for ad-lib .  about three-quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw .  gadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations ( not really " battles " ) with the evil gadget .  penny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon .  let me rage here just for a minute .  michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character .  she's utterly charming , and has excellent experience ( harriet the spy ) for the part of the pint-size detective .  why she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery .  the film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting ( or editing ) stupidity .  inspector gadget is missing the long , long stretches of potty humor that ( among other things ) made my favorite martian so unbearable , but it's a very short movie , so perhaps something was cut at the last moment .  probably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits .  the " evil sidekick support group " is especially worth seeing , and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it's onscreen .  all in all , another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films .  i wonder if disney uses the revenues for it's generally money-making cartoons to produce these losers .  but if true , why ?  if they're trying for another mary poppins , they need to find a team that can produce one , and then give them a chance to do it .  
 " i would appreciate it if you didn't do that again . "  starring jet li , bridget fonda , tch ? ky karyo , burt kwouk .  directed by chris nahon .  rated r .  it's no secret that martial arts film often use their plot simply to get from one action sequence to another .  when the fight scenes are enough to justify paying admission , there is no problem with this , as in most jackie chan projects and a lot of the hong kong actioners .  when they aren't , well , we're in bad shape .  kiss of the dragon , jet li's second consecutive american misfire , plays like one big miscalculation , and fails even as the most rudimentary entertainment .  now before i start getting e-mails angrily touting the genius of jet li , let me explain myself .  li is as spectacular as ever here , and i don't think anyone would ever dare call his martial-arts-star skills into question .  the problem isn't with him , it's with the movie's tone .  the much touted fight-scenes here are filmed with such unflinching , unrelenting brutality that they are unpleasant to watch .  they're joyless , perfuctory ; li's rogue chinese detective is more of a killing machine than a hero , a terminator with a black belt instead of a metal skeleton .  but even the terminator in judgement day had a sympathetic side .  the plot isn't relevant , but if you're curious , it's some nonsense about a chinese law enforcement officer ( li ) sent to paris to investigate a possible drug ring and encounter a corrupt chief of police ( tcheky karyo ) , who kills people and does sinister things with no motivation whatsoever .  oh yeah , and li's character is also an acupuncture expert who is able to ease pain and/or kill at the touch of a needle .   " kiss of the dragon " is the name of an acupuncture maneuver , in which you stick a needle in a precise location on the back of the victim's neck , somehow redirecting all of the body's bloodflow to the brain and killing the poor sap more or less immediately .  there's a vague attempt to humanize li by having him fall in love with a downtrodden prostitute , whose daughter is being held hostage , for some reason , by the villain .  this is one of the worst love stories i have ever seen on screen , even worse than the one in pearl harbor .  there's no conviction whatsoever as the movie barely pays lip service to it ; it's only here because someone apparently thought there should be some kind of boy-meets-girl subplot .  kiss of the dragon was written by luc besson , whose screenplay the messenger : the story of joan of arc , for all of that film's flaws , was at least thoughtful .  i don't know why the guy got himself involved in this train wreck , but perhaps he wanted to so something more mainstream after the neverending weirdness of the fifth element and the aforementioned stylized biopic .  i suppose you could call this mainstream , but i'll choose the bizarre any time of the day .  if action scenes in a movie are going to be brutal instead of dazzling , you need a story to justify watching them .  the filmmakers behind kiss of the dragon should have rethought their strategy .  no one will walk out of this misbegotten project smiling , but i hear rush hour 2 is coming in just a few weeks .  
has it really been two decades since walter matthau coached the bad news bears ?  nineteen years and two mighty ducks later , the formula is still going strong .  police academy graduate steve guttenberg stars as a small-town deputy sheriff corralled into co-coaching the school's hastily formed soccer team .  his partner-in-crime is the new british " exchange teacher " ( olivia d'abo ) , a lively lass who has obviously seen dangerous minds and knows that the best way to gain the respect of a disinterested , outer-city audience is to teach them something neat .  like soccer .  most of the good-natured gags are of the fast-motion variety , such as runaway cows and out-of-control lawnmowers .  kids will laugh at the occasional belching bit , while their parents peacefully doze beside them .  other than letting a supporting character named newt go unscathed , what's missing from the big green is a better integration of music and comedy .  instead of a peppy pop score , which would arguably work to better effect , most of the action is set to a bombastic orchestral score that belongs somewhere else .  comedy needs music .  just watch any old bugs bunny short .  the marx brothers knew it .  mel brooks knows it .  unfortunately , the current trend is to " overscore . "  lush strings and booming brass in every scene , at every moment .  remember the simple strains of bizet's " habanera " in the original bad news bears ?  these days , it's usually a bellowing fanfare that threatens to smother every scene in its path .  much like adding frosting to already frosted cake .  an awfully big adventure ========================  the reteaming of director mike newell and star hugh grant is about as far removed as you can get from the lightsome comedy of four weddings and a funeral .  their second collaboration is a downbeat theatrical drama about a young intern ( georgina cates ) struggling to survive in post-w . w . ii  liverpool .  hugh plays the gay director , an * extremely * unappealing character who may alienate whatever fans are left after the nonsense of nine months .  bleak make-up and thick accents conspire to make this a difficult story to settle into .  an awful adventure is not without * some * rewards , tho .  the peter pan subtext is intriguing .  as is the diverse ensemble cast that includes peter firth , alan rickman , and prunella scales .  basil !  devil in a blue dress =====================  the comparisons to chinatown are easy enough , except for the fact that this film isn't nearly as gripping .  writer/director carl franklin ( one false move ) is the force behind this accomplished-but-stiff adaptation of walter mosley's crime novel .  denzel washington is as sturdy as ever , but he's burdened with a miscast supporting cast .  tom sizemore and scene-stealer don cheadle are both fine .  the problems start with jennifer beales , who never registers as the plot's femme fatale .  she's a pretty face and nothing more .  also underweight are maury chaykin and terry kinney .  they play opposing mayoral candidates in 1948 los angeles and neither actor commands enough authority to stifle giggles .  john huston , we miss you !  fine period detail and a strong sense of humor are a plus .  they help to overcome a pace that's too polite for mosley's jazzy , swingin' story .  steal big , steal little =======================  i can't say much about this one .  director andrew davis follows the fugitive with a wildly unfunny farce about twin brothers ( andy garcia ) with opposing moral codes .  they're fighting over their adoptive mother's estate , a 40 , 000-acre ranch worth millions and supporting dozens of migrant farm workers .  so many different plots are trying to come together--feuding brothers , reconciling husbands , loan-shark hired hitmen--that you have to admire the director's ambition .  too bad that almost every single person or plot-line is out of sync .  that is , with the exception of alan arkin .  he's the best thing in a movie that--despite the work of four credited writers-- * still * manages to waste such diverse talents as david odgen stiers , kevin mccarthy , and joe pantolinao .  and what the heck does that title mean ?  
by starring in amy heckerling's " clueless " two summers ago , alicia silverstone proved she wasn't just another pretty , pouty ingenue , showing a buoyant comedic craftiness that blew all previous jobs -- namely a stint as the aerosmith girl and a silly turn as the lethal lolita of " the crush " -- out of the water .  her only work since that 1995 gem has been in june's " batman & robin , " where she overcame the underwritten role of batgirl .  now , she's the star and producer of " excess baggage , " a hopelessly phony film that demonstrates how an ill-composed story can drag an otherwise solid performer down to its level .  silverstone's emily t . hope is stuck with a billionaire father ( jack thompson ) who neglects her emotionally .  in an outlandish plan to gain his affection , she fakes her own kidnapping -- emily uses an electronically disguised voice to call her dad and set a pricey ransom , ties her legs together and mouth shut with duct tape and locks herself in the trunk of her bmw .  but before the police can " rescue " her , professional auto thief vincent roche ( benicio del toro ) jimmies the locks , hot-wires the engine and makes off with both the car and emily , who's still trapped in the back .  when vincent discovers emily , the two don't exactly hit it off -- she annoys him , he annoys her , and at the advice of his slimy car salesman partner ( harry connick , jr . ) , he decides to drive her out to the middle of nowhere and leave her there .  along the way , of course , they get into a whole heap of trouble , and come to realize that being together is the only way to get out of their sticky , felony-studded situation .  it doesn't help matters that emily and vincent are being trailed by cops , crooks and even her shady uncle ray ( christopher walken ) , who's wise to his niece's ploys for attention and has mafia connections .  for at least a half-hour , " excess baggage " bounces along fast and efficiently .  during this time , emily and vincent sport engaging personalities as well as a nice role-reversal twist -- she's an awfully aggressive , combative victim and he's quite the aloof , seemingly vulnerable captor .  but once it's past its set-up , the situation suddenly becomes uninvolving as the story tries to be too many things at once .  a road movie , a teen comedy , a mob thriller , a drama about family relationships -- you name the cliche and " excess baggage " likely covers its territory .  of course a romance develops between the two leads , but it all seems forced , and thus characterization is manipulated to cause the finally happy outcome .   " do you like my tummy ? "  emily coos to vincent at one point in the film .  huh ?  did i miss something ?  the hard-edged , foul-mouthed grrrl is suddenly gone and replaced with a pair of batting goo-goo eyes .  then again , " excess baggage " becomes so weak in so many areas that the personality transplant is not a complete surprise .  a supporting cast attempts to do what they can with colorful but empty secondary roles , but the movie isn't game enough to use them all and therefore seems overcrowded .  motivations keep shifting , resulting in an often confusing narrative .  scant existing story background confuses matters even worse and adds to the growing list of unanswered questions .   " excess baggage " has too many characters , too much plot and juggles with one arm behind its back and a remaining shaky hand .  i loved silverstone's turn in " clueless " as an aloof , pampered beverly hills matchmaker inspired by jane austen's " emma . "  looking back at the skill she displayed for comedy there , it's simple to justify any high expectation or enthusiasm that i had mustered for " excess baggage . "  sadly , however , " excess baggage " is no " clueless . "  but , on the other hand , it is clueless .  
it seemed like the perfect concept .  what better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ?  it's exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh .  jim carrey's signed on too ?  even better .  the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as " schizophrenia , " and so forth .  such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers' fire , proving that some people just couldn't take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy .  yes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn't funny .  it's not for lack of trying .  the farrellys utilize in " me , myself & irene " their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them .  this , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult .  soon enough , charlie's repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster .  this guy isn't above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he's been insulted , or holding a little girl's head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street .  then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks .  some have suggested that this isn't a problem , because the farrelly brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work .  they're wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys' last effort , 1996's " there's something about mary . "   ( 1999's " outside providence " was technically an earlier project . )  the brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected .  in " mary , " the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they'd have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion .   " me , myself & irene , " by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at " mary " and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work .  having been produced by the same guys who made " mary , " " irene " seems like an even bigger disappointment .  the brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes .  but they haven't come up with a way to make any of it fresh ; most of " me , myself & irene " comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy .  the plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who's in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that's entirely predictable from the get-go .   ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ?  yeah , me too . )  the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven't already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be .  compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it's no longer funny , merely gross .  the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry .  take , for example , the subplot involving charlie's three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) .  the incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face .  but by the end of the film , they're still doing the same schitck ; it hasn't been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn't been dropped either .  that's too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through .   " me , myself & irene " reeks of wasted opportunities .  there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie's new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank's actions .  this doesn't really happen ; nearly every supporting character learns about charlie's condition early on , so they don't have any opportunity to be surprised by it .  the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , " whitey " ) , but the script doesn't go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax .  jim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he's left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in " all of me . "  it's a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny .  carrey doesn't pull any stunts we don't expect him to pull , and the farrellys' script doesn't give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren't set up in any meaningful way .  perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better .  zellweger's irene is not a strong female lead ; mary in " mary " may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed .  irene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she's ditzy , clever , or neither .  as such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only " sane " person in the film .  chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this .  he , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected .  after viewing the shapeless mess that " me , myself & irene " eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves .  maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked .  but i don't believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style .  if the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they'll rebound just fine .  even after that happens , though , i'll still consider " me , myself & irene " to be a high-caliber misfire .  
senseless ( r ) marlon wayans is a very talented physical comedian , and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life .  alas , moments are simply that , moments , which are not enough to lift this fantasy/comedy above its one-joke premise .  granted , that one joke is initially amusing .  when wayans's darryl witherspoon , an economics major at stratford university , hits some dire financial straits , he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug that heightens all five senses .  after some initial side effects and problems controlling his superhuman senses , darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of his abilities and uses them to land a position at a highly esteemed corporate firm .  at this point , the film sounds more like senseful than senseless , but through some turns of the plot , darryl finds himself only able to use four of his five senses at once , essentially leaving him--yes--senseless .  this sets up some showcase moments for wayans's gift for physical comedy , especially when darryl loses his sense of feeling and his body goes completely , hilariously limp .  but these gags , and the gag behind the entire movie , quickly grows stale .  once darryl is shown without the use of all of the senses , instead of exploring any new comic territory , director penelope spheeris and screenwriters greg erb and craig mazin take the easy way out and simply recycle each form of senselessness .  wayans approaches each go-round with gusto , but by this point he's simply treading water for the rest of the film's unfunny duration .  senseless would not be as problematic as it is if it didn't strive to be anything more than a comic trifle .  however , the raucous and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity .  darryl goes through the experiment in order to help his cash-strapped family , and this " serious " angle seems to come from an entirely different movie .  unlike wayans's last starring vehicle , the surprisingly effective ( and serious ) the 6th man , the " emotional " content of senseless is forced and unconvincing .  any attempt at anything more substantial than broad comedy fizzles--darryl's romance with janice ( tamara taylor ) , a young woman who yearns for a man who is true to himself , does not generate sparks of any kind .  once his wb television sitcom the wayans bros . comes to an end , the genuinely funny marlon wayans has a promising big-screen future ahead of him .  but if he continues to associate himself with projects as flat as senseless , his film career could go the way of his once-promising older brother , damon , who is now set to make his comeback--on television .  
fantastically over hyped , godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen .  the film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands , then an attack on a boat from some beast , and finally we join dr . nick tatopoulos ( broderick looking about 17 years old ) doing some research in chernobyl .  some shady u . s government guys appear , and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints , from what looks like a giant lizard .  and what's more , this beast is heading for new york .  gulp !  although godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride , and at some points it is , there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie .  the main faults lie with the acting and writing , common problems with 'summer blockbuster' movies .  broderick is pretty useless as the hero , with no humour or a 'tough guy' image .  while emmerich's previous summer flick , independence day ( 1996 ) had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith , this has neither .  also , maria pitillo , as broderick's former girlfriend , is just as useless , with a chronic disability in acting .  she's incapable of showing emotion , speaks every line in the same way , and basically she's total crap .  it's up to french actor jean reno to save the day , and indeed he does , turning in a campy performance as a french secret agent .  shame he has such little screen time in such a overlong film .  hank azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named 'animal' , and he adds a little life to the picture .  also making an appearance is harry shearer ( probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons ) as a slimy news reporter .  o . k , so the acting is not up to par , but it never is in these movies .  but what about the script ?  well , that's not up to par either .  emmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write a script .  the dialogue is banal ( broderick looks at a lot of fish and utters 'that's a lot of fish . ' ) , and the character development is non existent ( reno plays the typical frenchman ( 'no croissant ? ' ) ,  broderick forever remains a geeky scientist . )  also , the film is seriously lacking a sense of humour .  the jokes that are uttered are pathetic , and there's an 'hilarious' running gag about siskel and ebert .   ( the mayor is mayor ebert , and is assistant is called gene !  ha ha ha ha ! . )  the plot is dire , and in the end just rips off jurassic park ( 1993 ) by having lots of baby godzilla's ( i . e .  velicorapters ) running around new york .  right , so the script and acting suck .  but what about the special effects ?  thankfully , they're are quite good .  godzilla is an impressive piece of cgi , although we don't see much of him because the movie is so dark .  the destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell .  but although they are impressive , they can't save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and boring movie .  the movie goes on for far too long aswell , and it can't seem to decide on a ending .  and of course , the ending itself leaves possibility for a sequel .  let's just hope one never arrives .  
suicide is pointless , everyone should know that .  so what's this movie like ?  you guessed it . . .  pointless .  the virgin suicides focuses on the lives of the five lisbon sisters , from the perspective of the teenage boys who are fascinated by them .  when the youngest lisbon sister commits suicide , it sets in motion a series of events that will change the lives of many people forever .  that's what the press materials for the film probably say .  now here's what i say : the virgin suicides is a huge waste of time .  boring , arty , pretentious junk that is about as entertaining as . . .  well as committing suicide .  the movie lost me early on , immediately following the scene where the younger daughter jumps to her death from her bedroom window .  the girl's father ( james woods ) holds her lifeless body in his arms as their horrified family looks on .  then , as the scene ends , the lawn sprinklers come on .  is that a joke ?  is that supposed to be amusing in some way ?  from then on , the movie failed to draw me back in .  performances are the only saving grace of the virgin suicides .  woods plays the only character who would actually interest me when he came onscreen , but the performance of kirsten dunst as the next youngest daughter lux is worth mentioning as well .  dunst has the potential to be a big star , if she chooses her projects well .  and while this film is awful , she manages to come away from it virtually unscathed .  there are also a few cameos in the film here and there , which only frustrate the audience as they leave you wanting more .  as a result , they all seem rather pointless ( although there's a brief role given to michael pare from eddie and the cruisers which turns out to be his best role since . . .  well since eddie and the cruisers ) .  perhaps the virgin suicides would have worked had the story not been told from the point of view of people who had very little access to the main characters .  we never get any significant insight into the girls and why they might be feeling what they're feeling .  all we really know is that mrs . lisbon ( kathleen turner ) is strict and keeps them on a short leash .  what mother doesn't ?  it's certainly no reason to commit suicide .  with the godfather part iii , sofia coppola proved that she had no business being in front of the camera .  with the virgin suicides , she proves she has no business behind it either .  having family connections doesn't entitle you to be allowed to make movies .  so attention film directors . . .  stop letting your daughters pout their way into the industry .  just because they share your dna doesn't mean they share your talent .

walt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century fox's anastasia .  but judging by the latest efforts from the don bluth studios , the visuals are the only thing fox has to brag about .  disney's recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and to a lesser extent , hercules .  with anastasia , fox has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the window .  some may say - so what ?  it's just a kid's movie .  well . . .  if you have young kids , beware , as they may be noticeably frightened by the visuals of a corpse-rotting rasputin zombie , whose body parts continually fall off in a disconcertingly real way .  consider yourselves warned .  nevertheless , the animation is quite stunning at times .  don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout , occasionally rivalling photographic quality .  and yet in other scenes , the hand-drawn material seems of the saturday-morning tv crowd , which leads me to wonder . . .  was this rushed to market to combat disney ?  the plot , as anyone who had read history before knows , concerns the attempt to return anastasia to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs in 1916 .  not that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened .  as for the plot --- go rent disney's candleshoe .  you'll see 60% of anastasia there .  
200 cigarettes takes place on new year's eve 1981 .  monica , played by martha plimpton is having a huge new year's party .  everyone in town is trying to get there , but some are caught up in other things .  this is the basic plot of 200 cigarettes .  as we meet the characters headed towards the party , we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal , and not interesting at all .  this disappointed me greatly .  the film should have been more about the party than the people trying to get there in my opinion .  lucy , played by courtney love , is with kevin , played by paul rudd .  the two are in a relationship that is more of a friendship , but starts to blossom into something more than that .  this subplot is extremely boring and dull , and i am getting quite sick of plots like that .  janeane garofalo is involved in another subplot , dealing with kevin .  she plays ellie , an ex-girlfriend of kevin's .  this subplot is completely a waste of garofalo's talent .  there was no point to it at all , and it was hardly even in the movie .  when lucy runs into a bartender , played by ben affleck , another subplot is formed .  the bartender is invited by lucy to come to monica's party .  at the bar , he runs into two more girls .  the girls are played by angela featherstone and nicole parker , but unfortunately , due to the terrible acting of both of them , i don't even remember their characters names .  ben affleck is a good actor , but his character doesn't go anywhere so he doesn't have much screen time to give a good performance .  featherstone and parker are horrible in their roles , and they are part of the reason the film is so bad .  christina ricci plays val , and gaby hoffman plays stephie .  the two girls are trying to get to the party but are extremely lost .  they meet some guys and end up going around with them all night .  this subplot was alright , but it was quite annoying with stephie's accent .  hoffman did an okay job of acting , but ricci did good .  she was underused , considering she is such a wonderful actress .  another subplot in the film is the relationship between cindy , played by goldie hawn's daughter , and jack , played by jay mohr .  jack is an actor who doesn't care about the girls he goes out with , he just likes dates for one night , and the next day he doesn't .  kate hudson is a huge klutz .  she gets herself into very funny situations , that are the funniest parts in the entire movie .  they are probably the only funny parts in the entire movie as well .  this subplot could have been used more , mainly due to hudson's performance .  mohr wasn't good , but he wasn't bad .  he was just alright , which i didn't find acceptable .  there is not much to say about the performances in the film .  none of the characters are developed or shown enough to really tell if the acting is good or not .  the only performances that i can judge are christina ricci's as always good performance , kate hudson's funny role , courtney love's mediocre performance , and paul rudd's annoying and overused performance .  i was hoping for a little more out of jaw mohr , ben affleck , casey affleck , gaby hoffman , dave chapelle , and especially out of janeane garofalo .  the two strongest things in the film were the great soundtrack and the original costumes .  martha plimpton and christina ricci had very different and original outfits which made me feel like i was in the year 1981 .  the soundtrack is full of 1980's tunes , ranging from " i want candy " to " tainted love . "  the songs in the movie also helped create the feel that you were back in the 1980s .  during the film , i often found myself asking the questions , " is there a reason to this ?  is there any moral story ?  is there a point ?  are any of the events going on in the film necessary ?  do i care what lucy and kevin are going through ? "  the movie is extremely boring , and by the time they reached eleven-o-clock , one hour before midnight , i could not wait for the movie to be over .  the plot is okay , but the subplots make it terrible .  maybe if the film was about the party , not about the people at the party , it could have been a lot better .  the bottom line : just like a slasher movie , this ? 80s comedy is just one too many .  
my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love .  i love ralph fiennes .  i love uma thurman .  i love sean connery .  hell , i'm even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw .  i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i've been eagerly awaiting the film ever since .  a few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground .  then , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics .  and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs .  and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique .  my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things .  the film i saw today didn't even meet those expectations .  this is a lousy , incoherent mess .  i would slam it harder , if it weren't for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors .  but sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired .  that's the main problem with the avengers : for all it's hip-hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired .  it's like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making .  it also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots .  this is just plain depressing .  the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show .  frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i've never watched an episode .  i wasn't alive then .  i don't even watch television now .  i'm very sorry that i don't have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i've already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse .  i didn't know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles .  i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film .  based on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr . peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits .  they are to work together , under mother's orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co-conspirator , father , is played by the equally-talented fiona shaw ) .  it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather .  his name is de wynter ( connery ) .  he is a crazy scottish guy .  our heroes had better stop him , or else .   .   .  the weather will keep getting colder until they " have to go to hell to warm up " ( one of the film's few funny lines ) .  along the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense .  for example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos .  now , killer bugs don't really go with the weather-controlling theme of the film .  the purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established .  they're never even directly connected to de wynter ( they're controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard ) .  the special effects aren't bad , but they're loud , obnoxious , and intrusive .  like so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning .  and i guarantee you , it will wane .  i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn't do any good to think .  the avengers has clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn't tell us what happens .  there are several scenes in the preview that didn't make the final cut .  in addition , many of the sequences have irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low-budget ( the last scene is particularly bad ) .  the scenes that don't feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast .  they aren't .  the action scenes should be electric , because this is an action film .  they aren't , either .  and what about this wasted cast ?  oh , it makes me weep with disappointment .  we're talking ralph fiennes here , one of the best actors working today , one of the best actors * ever * .  i love the guy .  i've loved all his films , until this one .  he seems like he wants to understand the film , but he's as lost as we are .  and thurman , in all of her spectacular beauty and talent , can't manage to look at home here .   ( i don't blame her completely , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way , and it can't be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting . )  connery , however , seems the most out of it , totally lacking any kind of focus , or interest , for that matter .  who is to blame ?  is it the screenwriter , don macpherson ?  perhaps , although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right .  is it the actors ?  for god's sake , no -- these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling .  i blame director jeremiah chechik , who shouldn't have been given the task to begin with .  his best film , benny & joon , is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be , but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor .  add to that a lack of experience in big-budget action , and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory .  if the avengers has a saving grace , it's the set design .  the sets ( by stuart craig ) are big , colorful , and often pleasing to look at .  i like the final set-piece , on de wynter's island , even if none of it makes a bit of sense .  i admired the overhead view of the stairs , showing dr . peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere .  i also enjoyed michael kamen's music score , particularly in the opening credits .  but this stuff is routine -- good sets and music are nice , but there's a lot more that needs to be here .  inspiration , for instance , would have been really nice .  maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story .  or a sense of purpose .  most of all , though , i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles .  damn this movie for not giving them the chance .  
sometimes a stellar cast can compensate for a lot of things , and " pushing tin " certainly features some name stars who are going places : billy bob thornton , cate blanchett , angelina jolie , and oh yes john cusack who might not realize it at first , but he's actually the * veteran * among this quartet of fine-looking people .  sometimes a terrific cast like this can compensate for a lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has " hip comedy " written all over it , compensate for workmanlike but uninspired direction , compensate for an obnoxious score that would have anyone but the tone deaf screaming for the exits , compensate for clich ? d characterizations , compensate for embarrassing " you have to be joking " situations .  etc .  in " pushing tin , " thornton , blanchett , jolie , and cusack don't have an earthly .  from the opening sequence the film is in big trouble : squiggly , " quirky " credits , fake-looking passenger planes circling new york , and anne dudley's in-your-ear music making us wonder how she ever got that best original score nomination for " the full monty , " let alone won it .  but i , for one , wasn't ready to walk just yet .  so quickly we descend into a tightly-edited air traffic controllers montage which screams to us in large capital letters these people have a difficult job , yes , what with their frantic , mile-a-minute instructional personas , juggling planes and passenger's lives like some huge , real , mid-air video game .  hip , cool , demonic auctioneer nick " the zone " falzone ( cusack ) is the best in the biz .  of course .  until some hipper , cooler , leather-clad flyboy assist in the guise of russell bell ( thornton ) shows up to challenge falzone's finite air space .  boys will be boys and some heavy duty testosterone starts exuding , then the macho one-upmanship begins .  it doesn't stop with seeing who can juggle three 747s within a cat's whisker of each other .  oh no .  there are some broken hoop dreams , some wanna-see-how-fast-i-can-drives , and then the ultimate showdown : was that my wife i saw you with last night ?  director mike newell ( " four weddings and a funeral " ) must have read a different draft of this script because the one that's being acted out up there between newark , jfk , and la guardia doesn't have an ounce of subtlety , and newell has made some awfully good-and funny-movies before .  the antics of these air traffic controllers will make you cringe .  they'll make you frown in disbelief .  they'll have you constantly looking at your watch .  but wait !  there's still 100 minutes to go ! !  the film's only saving grace is blanchett , whose connie falzone is a spunky , brash , long island housewife who wants to better herself by taking art classes .  this is a wonderful accomplishment for the fine actress who has previously played a red-headed australian gambler ( " oscar and lucinda " ) and a tempestuous british monarch ( " elizabeth " ) .  but she's not enough to save the picture .  thornton looks terrific and performs solidly but his character is a joke .  jolie ( as russell's knock 'em dead wife ) isn't bad , but the up-and-coming actress disappoints by allowing herself to be displayed like a plaything .  cusack cracks gum , dons shades , and acts hip throughout but , like everything else in the film , his performance is forced .  in the last ten minutes or so , for some inexplicable reason , things start coming together and you begin to get a sense of how this film might have been , like the trailer teases .  but it's too little too late .  a fine cast aside , " pushing tin " is nothing more than an embarrassment .  
some movies' pre-release buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when they're finally released , everyone just goes along with it .  thus sometimes , films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations .  last year it was the thin red line .  this year's " winner " is the hurricane , pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office oscar pool .  acclaimed director norman jewison's biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the fun .  and that's supposed to be ok because , see , it's a true story .  it's about rubin " hurricane " carter ( denzel washington ) , a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly ( racist ! )  detective ( dan hedaya ) who's had it in for the " big-shot " hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife ( in self-defense but who cares , right ? )  when rubin was only ten .  he is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole .  most of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison .  to the rescue -- lesra martin ( vicellous reon shannon ) and his team of wanna-be detectives .  lesra is an african american teenager taken in by three well-off canadian white people ( hanna , unger , schreiber ) to get an education .  lesra and his buddies go to a book sale where lesra picks out his very first book -- " the sixteenth round , " rubin's autobiography .  immediately thereafter , schreiber's character tells lesra " sometimes we don't pick the books we read , they pick us . "  hmmm .  after a few visits to the prison , they become convinced of rubin's innocence and launch their own full-scale investigation even though two juries have convicted him .  they meticulously go through all the files and revisit all the old witnesses ( i wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door in their faces ? ) and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricane's innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings .  of course , we're already told that he's innocent .  a movie like this is especially frustrating because we're not being shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period in his life .  all too obviously , we're getting the hollywood watered- down version .  that would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it .  it's almost cruel .  the melodrama isn't of the entertaining kind either ; it's the hokey , rammed-down-your-throat variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity .  witness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudo-saintliness of our four protagonists .  the hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except it's a no-frills courtroom movie .  it's formula stripped to the bare necessities .  you have your wrongly accused black man .  you have your melodramatic final courtroom scene .  but there's nothing else .  you'd expect some sort of involving investigation .  but that's not necessary since we're implicitly informed of his innocence .  thus the whole middle portion of the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding .  brooding to himself .  brooding to other inmates .  brooding to lesra .  brooding to lesra's canadian friends .  brooding in letters .  i don't think i'll ever look at brooding the same way again .  it wasn't long before i got tired of hearing the hurricane's exceedingly deep meditations on his condition .  i wanted something to happen .  as for washington's performance in the title role -- i figured i'd have to address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention it's received -- he is top notch , though still boring .  how is that possible ?  well , he does what jewison wanted him to do perfectly .  unfortunately what jewison asked him to do is a load of crap .  what a waste of a great performer .  speaking of wastes , why the hell did john hannah agree to do this ?  he's an extremely talented actor and i love him dearly , but what is he doing here ?  to call his character ( along with schreiber's and unger's ) a stick figure would be a gross understatement .  all three of them come off as veritable mother theresas , as benevolent as do-gooders come .  if they're to play a major part in this movie , why not make them real people , with real feelings and emotions ?  look : if you're going to make a formula movie , don't undermine the formula .  courtroom dramas can be fun , but this is ridiculous .  not only is it trite , it's boring .  
susan granger's review of " ghosts of mars " ( sony pictures entertainment )  horror auteur john carpenter ( " halloween , " " vampires " ) strikes out with this sci-fi eco-fable that's so bad it boggles the mind to imagine how the project ever got green-lit .  the script by carpenter and larry sulkis appears to have been lifted directly from last year's " pitch black , " involving a violent prisoner who must be released from bondage so that he can help a small band of humans protect themselves from blood-thirsty , marauding aliens .  in the year 2176 , there are 640 , 000 earthlings on mars , living in a matriarchal society led by a commander , played by pam grier .  grier , pill-poppin' natasha henstridge , and some rookie mars police officers ( clea duvall , jason statham ) travel to the remote mining town of shining canyon to fetch " desolation " williams - that's ice cube - to bring him back to chryse city to stand trial for murder .  but when they're besieged by demented , zombie-like , body-snatching miners , they readily free the scowling ice cube since they need him for protection .  it seems a red cloud was released from a shining canyon cave and , soon after , most of the miners went bonkers as long-dormant remnants of an ancient martian civilization took over their minds and bodies , lopping off heads as " vengeance for anything that tries to lay claim to their planet , " according to a scientist ( joanna cassidy ) .  carpenter uses so many flashbacks to tell the " night of the living dead " -like story that the idiotic plot gets incomprehensibly confusing .  but you can easily predict each of the supporting characters who will be killed , along with the order of their elimination .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " ghosts of mars " thuds to a laborious , bottom-of-the-barrel 1 .  perhaps , indeed , there is a curse on mars films , if you recall two other duds : " mission to mars " and " red planet . "  
 " we are grateful that we have the songs of grace chan to comfort us . "  starring lee kang-sheng , yang kuei-mei directed by tsai ming-liang written by tsai and yang ping-ying cinematography by liao peng-jung  taiwan , 24/12/99 .  the millenium approaches .  an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city .  sectors of the city are being sealed , quarantined due to the onset of a mysterious virus .  the virus causes people to act like insects : they crawl about on all fours , hide from bright lights , huddle in damp corners .  the water supply to the quarantined zones will be cut off in a week's time .  residents are advised to evacuate the area , asap .  this premise--kafka by way of cronenberg--is the background for the hole , which could have been a great movie , but , sadly , ends up as a waste of good ideas .  the quick sketch above suggests a dark , absurd , hallucinatory near-future parable of life in the late 20th century ; in execution , however , it is nothing like that .  the virus , the evacuation , the visual possiblities of the deluge : these are all relegated to the background .  instead , the hole focuses on the lives--for want of a better word--of a man ( lee kang-sheng ) and a woman ( yang kuei-mei ) who live in the same apartment building , and who have no personalities .  the entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly and sterile : the charmless rooms and corridors of a post-industrial apartment complex , photographed to look as dim and dingy as possible .  it's a vivid setting , but an unappealing one , especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain and the gurgle of drainage pipes in the background .  the man lives in the apartment directly above the woman's .  one day , a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in the floor of the man's living room , opening into the ceiling of the woman's living room .  this hole--symbol of the solitary opening in the character's lonely , compartmented lives--allows them to interact in unusual ( and mostly non-verbal ) ways .  example : the man , suffering from the onset of the virus ( or so i assume--everything is obscure in this movie ) vomits through the hole .  the woman , wandering around in the dark , accidentally puts her hand on his vomit , and then cleans it up .  this is what passes for meaningful communication .  and they say romance is dead .  much of the film does not even focus on their interactions , such as they are .  there is almost no dialogue and we learn next to nothing about these people .  they are ciphers .  instead , we are treated to long takes in which we witness their miserable lives ; we watch , for instance , as the woman boils some water , pours it onto some noodles , then eats the noodles .   ( this is as fascinating as it sounds . )  offered as counterpoint--or perhaps relief--to these dreary sequences are a series of musical numbers , fantasies in which the woman lip-synchs to pop songs by grace chan ( popular , so i'm told , in 1950s' china ) .  she prances around in grimy hallways and grungy stairwells , incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights .  sometimes , in these fantasies , she is joined by the man .  these scenes are presumably intended to be bright and fanciful , sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality , but they fail .  when the man and the woman dance , it seems half-hearted and listless .  astaire and rogers this is not .  even in imagination , these people are numb , weary , boring .  the hole is part of the 'collection 2000' series , a group of films commissioned by french tv station la sept arte on the subject of the millenium .  others include canada's last night , brazil's midnight , and american hal hartley's the book of life .  the book of life is the only other one that i have seen , and it is infinitely superior to the taiwanese entry .  witty , energetic , humane , it makes the the hole seem ( ahem ) empty .  american movies with nothing to say try to disguise their lack of content with flashy movements , quick cuts , superficial emotions .  foreign movies with nothing to say do what the hole does : they point the camera at something of minimal interest for unbelievably long periods of time , and call it art .  the hole is self-evidently a film about alienation , and perhaps director tsai ming-liang wants the audience to share in his characters' alienation .  if so , he succeeds .  perhaps it is a challenge : he dares us to enjoy this movie , despite his best attempts to ensure that we don't .  if it was a challenge , i wasn't up for it .  
when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain , you know that you can expect nothing more than a b grade action movie .  however , since this film also featured michael madsen , more than capable character actor , this time in the role of protagonist , the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt .  however , the very first scenes show clear b grade action credentials - madsen plays richard montana , tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio ( played by lynch ) .  however , the raid was only partially successful , and montana is getting the rap .  so , he begins his own private war against gio , trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt .  in the process , he meets gio's mistress gina zamora ( played by rosie vela ) and starts relationship with her too .  although it doesn't stink like many of the similar films can , inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade action routine .  nobody in this film actually puts much effort , including madsen or lynch , and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke .  the only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela , who , apart from showing her more than impressive looks , shows some of the singing talent too .  however , this isn't reason enough for viewers to spend hour and half watching a film that they would , in most likelihood , forget the next day .  
apparantly money talks .   .   .  and uses quite a bit of obscenities doing so !  i've always considered myself pretty open about the gratuity a film can possess , whether in language , violence , sex , or what have you .  i find that this fact gives me a little more leverage to complain when a movie goes overboard , and money talks definitely does !  it's not so much that the movie swore nearly constantly ( and i mean constantly ! ) , but it swore so much that it seemed overly prominent and way too staged .  perhaps if one character were foul mouthed , but in this film , everybody swears nearly every other word .  money talks is about a black ticket scalper named franklin hatchett ( played less annoyingly than expected by chris tucker ) .  franklin is your typical con-man and ends up with more than one person out to get him .  when the plot finally gets underway , there's no less than three people ( or groups ) that want him , dead or alive .  the frenchman who's somewhat responsible for franklin's escape from a prisoner-packed bus , a hoodlum whom franklin owes seven grand , and the cops who wrongly suspect him of murder .  franklin's only hope : james russell ( charlie sheen ) , an investigative reporter for the local news who's out to prove himself a worthy journalist .  james offers to help clear franklin's name if franklin will just allow him an exclusive report to help channel 12 conquer sweeps week .  both of these elements are completely lost along the way however , and never do reappear .  as expected , the odd couple of franklin and james do wind up friends at the end , which is another wasted element seeing as how they show no signs of becoming friends at any point along the way .  there is just nothing original or intriguing about this film , and so many developments are either non-relevant , or just plain forgotten about .  money talks is a paint-by-numbers movie that lacks any real involvment with the audience .  frivilous dialogue , a predictable , flat storyline , and two-dimensional characters make money talks a reason to save your money .  
the second serial-killer thriller of the month is just awful .  oh , it starts deceptively okay , with a handful of intriguing characters and some solid location work .  after a baby-sitter gets gutted in the suit- ably spooky someone's-in-the-house prologue , parallel stories unfold , the first involving a texas sheriff ( r . lee emery ) , a gruesome double murder , and the arrival of a morose fbi agent ( dennis quaid ) on the eve of voting for the local lawman's reelection .  the second pairs a hitch- hiker ( jared leto ) with a friendly former railroad worker ( danny glover ) .  they're headed west , toward the rockies and away from the murder scene .  which one is the killer ?  well , it doesn't really matter , 'cause when writer/first-time director jeb stuart ( die hard ) finally spills the beans , you won't take his choice seriously anyway .  the whole thing goes south about an hour in , with the tale taking hairpin turns that i certainly couldn't follow .  and through the whole thing there's quaid , playing with the most intense monotony this side of steven sea- gal .  i guess i'm glad that i didn't walk out-- there's some nice train stuff at the end and a fun nod to dr .  strangelove .  
running time approximately 1hr 40mins  reviewed by jack choo  rating :  the movie starts with a rather se7en-ish opening sequence , rather cool and sets the mood for things to come .  the story propels the audience into a neo-reality ; somewhat very close to conscious reality but laced with weird tinges of blue and red .  existenz is actually the name of a new virtual-reality game .  supposedly , vr games are highly popular as is considered a legal-drug in this neo-reality .   * * * * ( leigh ) is the ultimate game creator and introduces her ultimate game-experience in the form of existenz .  players are required to have bio-ports embedded in their spine , which plugs to a game-pod in order to enjoy the immersive experience .  during a secretive beta-testing-cum-teaser meeting for this new game , an assassination attempt on * * * life occurs and she runs off with fellow bodyguard * * * ( law ) .   * * * is more of a realists than anything else , afraid that he'll lose reality if he begin to play these games but * * * requires his help to immerse together with her into existenz to check if the program is still functioning properly after the assassination attempt .  as they soon discover , they are transported between realities within existenz uncovering more than they initially expected .  existenz has all the cronenberg-gore that is expected of him .  even so , this film is no-where near his cult classics such as videodrome or scanners .  not even half as suspenseful as the commercially successful the fly .  existenz can probably be looked upon as his 90's version of videodrome , even so , it is a poor follow-up .  while in most of his famed films , his penchant for gore always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot .  in existenz , the gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of the film and seem to be an act of over-indulgence than anything else .  jennifer jason leigh and jude law , both commendable actors , looked aloof and miss-directed throughout the entire film .  the scripting and acting barely pulls the film out of the b-grade category .  it was obvious that cronenberg worked on a really tight-budget and it seems that he handled that pretty well in the production design and values created for this film ( the opening sequence , though , probably formed a considerable portion of the budget ! )  which is actually quite good .  existenz is too predictable and cliched in these times .  10 years ago , it would have been another classic for cronenberg .  cronenberg fans however , ( those people who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation on film ) should not give this film a miss as some form of appreciation can still be offered by you .  
years ago , robin williams made _jumanji_ , a brilliant achievement in special effects , but a travesty on nearly every other level .  the same can be said for _what dreams may come_ , a boring , illogical , weepie-wannabe that left my senses numb .  don't get me wrong : i love breathtaking special effects and pulse-pounding imagery .  _brazil_ is on my personal top ten .  _the city of lost children_ is a great film because of its outlandish scenarios .  i even love _2001_ and _last year at marienbad_ , being in the minority amidst my friends .  _what dreams may come_ , imagery aside , has little daring thought to complement its imagery .  the daring thought it _does_ have is never fully realized .  it's idea of a plot is so lukewarm , that it insults the bigger questions it raises .  it would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live action sequences , put on an electronica soundtrack , and sell it as one of those popular _mind's eye_ videos .  robin williams plays chris nielsen , who dies too prematurely--not only in the story , but before we have a chance to really know and care for him .  the director , vincent ward , and the screenwriter ronald bass , have chosen to tell his life story in flashbacks while having the foreground story focus on his experience with the afterlife .  big mistake .  it would have been far better to take the half-hour or so needed to tell his life story first ( ala _it's a wonderful life_ ) , so that i can build up respect for him , so i could know and possibly care for him , his children , and his long-suffering wife ( played superbly by annabella sciorra ) .  instead , the filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the story , expecting that the film to grow in depth as it progresses .  it doesn't .  so in the afterlife , chris learns that ( a ) people still don't meet god , ( b ) that our thoughts are reality , and ( c ) time does not exist there .  hmm . . .  i+ll grant one of those silly giant ideas for the sake of the narrative .   ( the " not meeting god " part still irks at me , but perhaps there was no possible way to film it and give it due respect ) .  that said , this alternate reality still makes no possible sense .  read on . . .  chris' wife commits suicide .  since suicides go to hell , chris would be separated from his wife forever .  the important question is , is heaven really heaven if you are separated from the one you love ?  good question .  and i like good thought-provoking questions .  i don+t like it when the filmmakers deviate from the question .  i _loathe_ it when the filmmakers deviate from the question so that the film becomes a popular rescue film , especially a rescue film which does not take its underlying premise seriously .  i _really_ loathe it when it+s story is no longer run by logic , but by special effects .  hey chris : did you forget ?  your thoughts are _real_ .  they are more _real_ than the physical world , according to the new-age screenplay .  so , why don+t you conjure up positive thoughts of annie , and let that run wild ?  and then she would appear before you , and you two would live in happy bliss for eternity ?  because there would be no movie , that+s why .  and albert the angel ( played by miscast cuba gooding , jr . ) says bluntly : " that+s fantasy . "  umm . . .  if your thoughts are more real than the physical , then fantasy is not fantasy , but real .  surely some eastern meditation specialist would be able to tell you that .  and if you happen to think that you are an unimaginative person , and that your thoughts aren't big enough to sustain you for eternity , well , in all due respect , that's why i don't subscribe to this theology .  all due respect .  another idea , based on " time , ( pause ) , does not exist here ! "  so chris , spend your eternity with annie , as she is on earth , reliving your favorite memories , or hang out with her when she was growing up .  you+ve got eternity : perhaps you can hang around long enough and learn not to freak her out .  and forcing her to write " i still exist " in her diary , imo , is just too tacky .  there are many other ideas , all of which are a hundred times better than what+s unraveled in the plot .  the great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have been done before , and just come out stale .  most insulting is the subplot where important people in chris+ life appear in heaven differently than he expects , so when they finally show themselves , he realizes they were with him all along .  and when this happens , the film runs in slow motion , as if to build emotion .  _gag me with a spoon_ .  so the only things for me to like are sciorra+s effective performance , who rises far above this mundane material , and the special effects .  please note that while i enjoyed some of the visuals , i did not enjoy _all_ of them : some of the images looked like sandy duncan universe , everybody floating up and down in invisible strings .  it sounds like a joke , but it+s really true : i really tried to block out the dialogue , and figure out what music would best work as an alternative soundtrack .  my vote goes to a rare cd called " never say die " ( 1981 ) from petra , a christian rock group .  it+s pretty good , and they have a song about annie , who commits suicide .   ( it+s too late for annie/she+s gone away for good/there+s so much we'd have told her/and now we wish we could/but it+s too late . . . ) .  melancholic , yes .  depressing , yes .  but far more entertaining . . .  so , in case you don+t know , let me be straight .  suicide--bad .  _don+t do it_ .  no . no . no . ( got it ? --you  shouldn+t have to pay $7 . 50 to hear this in an awful robin williams schmaltzfest . )  
summer movies are , by nature , dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment and to make money .  wild wild west , the latest will smith affair , follows much the same formula , except that it is dumber and less enjoying than most summer movies .  will smith plays jim west , a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglasses .  he is called by president grant ( kline ) to go on a mission to find out why top government scientists are disappearing .  west is paired up with scientist artemus gordon ( kline again ) and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind , named dr . loveless ( branagh , with a zany moustache . )  before i pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair , i'll give it a chance with the positives .  there's a nice credit sequence , the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye , and the special effects are decent enough .  there's also a pleasant soundtrack .  buried deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes .  and salma hayek pops up as the female interest , which is always nice to see .  apart from these factors , though , nothing else in wild wild west works .  firstly , there's little chemistry between smith and kline , who appears to be in it purely for the money .  one would expect zingers passing between the two : none arise .  both of them plod through the below standard plot , knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end .  not even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment : although he is over the top , the material doesn't present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy .  therefore , he just comes across as loud as obnoxious .  the only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek , who is given so little screen time it's embarrassing .  she appears to be in the film to merely show off her body , and be ogled at by kline and smith .  her character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script , and there is no sense of realism about the character .  the 'humour' in the film is also very off .  will smith put a little spin to his daft lines in men in black , here , not even smith could save the humour on display .  the script largely boils down to insults that aren't very funny , and one-liners that barely raise a smirk .  it's also somewhat racist , although it doesn't intend to be , with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of a lynching , and actually says slavery is good to save himself .  it's not a funny scene , and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably .  the film also makes the tragic mistake that a man ( in this case kline ) in a dress is automatically unfunny , it isn't , but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness .  there's also problems with the plot .  jim west and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations , but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying , and rely purely on luck , rather than audience pleasing skill .  plot elements are introduced into the film , and then thrown away just as quickly .  the main piece of the story , a 80 foot mechanical , steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive , but there's no particular reason why it should be built .  why not loveless build a great big tank , instead of an ungainly , fragile piece of machinery that's just begging to be blown up ?  director barry sonnenfeld always has a breezy look to them , with some nice camera tricks , but even this is missing from this stilted affair .  wild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing , but not much of it is evident , making this film drag out even more .  it's a sad thing when _four_ ( credited ) screenwriters , a talented director and a willing star can't make a film work , and eventually wild wild west collapses under it's sexist , mildly racist , unfunny weight .  
talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters !  spice world is the feature film debut of the pre-fabricated pop band , the spice girls .  it's intended as a sort of hard day's night , but ends up simply hard to watch .  when watching the spice girls , i'm reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick ( such as from the smurfs , the snorks , or teenage mutant ninja turtles ) in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name .  the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles , and about as talented .  there's ginger ( geri halliwell ) , the brainy one , sporty ( melanie chisholm ) , the athletic one , baby ( emma bunton ) , the childish one , posh ( victoria adams ) , the fashion-conscious one , and scary ( melanie brown ) , the one with a tongue pierced back so far you're almost certain the post sticks out her throat .  the film itself doesn't really have a plot .  it follows the girls as they travel here and there , culminating at their " first live performance " at albert hall .  the action , however , seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas .  the various misfires include : an alien encounter , a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls , the shooting of a spice girls documentary , a movie producer ( george wendt ) trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie ( nearly all of which , though incredibly far fetched , seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up ) , a meeting with a pregnant friend ( whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends ) , a boating adventure , a bus race , club-hopping ( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd . . . even  when they start to sing ) , and an assorted number of musical performances , press conferences , and general all-around celebrity stuff .  whew .  for some reason , the film is littered with star cameos .  from elton john to elvis costello , from bob hoskins to meat loaf .  heck , even roger moore shows up , though he can't decide if he's parodying himself as james bond , or if he's lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld .  richard e . grant has the largest secondary part , a thankless role of the band's manager , clifford .  the celebrity spotting is partially amusing , and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film .  neither amusing or spontaneous , when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring .  their songs are alright , but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos .  my advice to fans is : stay home and watch that video collection , or at least spin that cd a couple of more times . . . either  option will be more enjoyable than the film .  non-fans should know to stay well away from this one .  
there is a scene early in jakob the liar that hints at how much better it could have been .  the scene is set in a jewish ghetto in poland circa 1944 , where a one-time cafe proprietor named jakob heym is walking resolutely through the streets , fists stuffed into coat pockets .  to one side of him , residents scavenge for food in the street ; to the other side , german troops beat a group of jews .  jakob , however , never stops moving .  it's an efficient , effective set-up for the character , who is clearly nobody's idea of a hero at the outset .  he is a man who has responded to the horror of his surroundings by withdrawing from them , excising his moral peripheral vision .  the set-up is critical because fate will turn jakob into a reluctant savior .  after a visit to a german commandant's office and a moment alone with a turned-on radio , jakob learns that russian troops are quite near .  when he brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow jews , they become convinced that he must have a radio , which is a punishable offense in the ghetto .  the good news brings hope to the ghetto ; the everyday specter of suicide vanishes .  a private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened with creating stories of russian military progress just to keep his neighbors alive .  this promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is burdened from the outset by casting : the " ordinary person " in question , jakob heym , is played by robin williams .  i am of the depressing opinion that williams is growing less assured as an actor in his " serious " roles with every passing year .  compare his dramatic scenes in the world according to garp and moscow on the hudson with what dreams may come or patch adams , and see how much more mannered he has become ( or , at the very least , how much less sensible at choosing material ) .  jakob the liar depends on the notion that jakob has to struggle to craft his fictions , but williams always looks like he's struggling _not_ to craft them .  when he improvises a radio address by winston churchill for ailing 10-year-old orphan lina ( hannah taylor gordon ) , he seems relieved that he can finally get wacky .  oh yes , and then there's that little girl .  some viewers will undoubtedly consider the hero's fanciful stories for a young charge too reminiscent of life is beautiful , but those scenes aren't problematic because they're familiar .  they're problematic because they're jarring and distracting , introducing a cutesy relationship into a film that shouldn't have been about cutesy relationships .  jakob's character arc may be about his willingness to act for the benefit of others , but there are plenty of others without poor little lina .  every scene with her feels contrived , pulling jakob the liar away from its central story of hope coming to a previously hopeless people .  it is a pleasant surprise to find that jakob the liar is a much grittier production than you might expect from a hollywood-ized holocaust , combining the weighty subject matter with dark humor in some effective ways .  director peter kassovitz , working from jurek becker's novel , crafts some nice scenes between jakob and the other townspeople , and draws solid performances from armin mueller-stahl ( as a once-revered doctor ) and bob balaban ( as a barber drifting into depression ) .  there are just too many things going on that prove distracting , whether it's the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter , or williams' incongrous presence , or a sweet but utterly irrelevant little girl .  jakob the liar deals with too delicate a subject for such fumbling , and has too compelling a central character to waste .  and after one wonderful early scene , you can see the film wasted and fumbled away .  
robin hood : men in tights is another mel-brooks-produced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein .  mel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life , his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit .  unfortunately , robin hood : men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles , none of the fun acting of young frankenstein , is devoid of the charm of spaceballs , and is even lacking the good , solid dialogue of history of the world .  it is , in short , one of the worst movies i have seen mel brooks , or anybody else , produce .  the plot borrows heavily from the well-received kevin costner movie of last year , robin hood : prince of thieves .  this is not surprising in and of itself , and could have been used to great comic effect , mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie .  mel brooks does not take advantage of this , however , and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air , none of which connect and none of which are explained later on .  the movie's scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice .  cary elwes , of princess bride fame , plays robin of loxley , a man who was captured in the crusades , fighting with king richard .  he escapes and , joining with a man named achoo ( i am sure you can see the obvious joke ) , fights in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard , which has been captured by evil prince john , played by funny comic richard lewis .  he also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil " sheriff of rottingham " .  a good adventure plot that is sadly unused .  elwes and lewis are both excellent comics , but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating .  neither actor has any good words to work with , and the lines simply aren't funny , nor believable .  perhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone .  this particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted , and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas , that i really felt like leaving the theatre .  much of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout , and some left the theatre .  chuckles were few and far between , and they mostly dealt with visual jokes ( such as an old , beaten up horse from " rent-a-wreck " ) then from any dialogue whatsoever .  scenes that could have been classics , such as the archery contest , are ruined by poor acting .  perhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive .  the basic plot , that robin has received a key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian , is not witty nor funny .  mel brooks as a circumcision-giving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience ( not all jewish , either ) .  the movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails .  the addition of a blind man who stumbles around , falling off cliffs , walking into ledges and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous potential , but is also made terribly offensive .  the only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard .  he is well worth waiting for , if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue , excruciating visual humor , old puns , ancient jokes and bad acting .  if you can't , don't even bother watching this miserable film .  
 " have you ever heard the one about a movie so bad that it made a guy run out of the theatre screaming ? "  obviously the producers at columbia tristar did not think that we suffered enough from the first installment , and so to finish us utterly , they have now released " urban legends : final cut " .  this is another " scream " -like feature , consisting merely from the recycled materials of rip-offs from the most pointless movies of all time .  amy ( jennifer morrison ) is a film student who is attending a film school filled with uninspired film students who do not have a clue about what to do .  but just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious university's film program -- where each year's best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize , a virtual one-way ticket to hollywood success -- she has a chance encounter with campus security guard reese ( loretta devine ) , whose tale of a series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her hand at a fictional thriller organized along similar lines .  soon enough , fake -- and real -- blood starts to flow , and amy is being chased around by scary killer , while her cast and crew get slain , one by one .  is the culprit the original urban legends murderer , just some random psycho , !  a member of the faculty , one of her competitors for the hitchcock , or is there something even more stupid going on ?  this is another one of those tiring , pointless teen slasher flicks : neither scary , funny , or interesting .  it simply lacks the ability and the story to entertain .  the body counts and screams continue to grow , as the weak level of intelligence sinks rapidly .  in fact watching films like that after having watched " scary movie " is impossible keeping a serious face .  several times i tried to prevent myself from laughing , without succeeding .  and then i realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing .  it's the same thing that has been told and told and told over and over again as if it was the revelation of the century .  how many times must we tolerate the same clich ? s that have haunted the slasher genre since its birth ?  it has been so many films about masked killers that most of us have developed an allergy for them .  they are the most stupid , meaningless , predictable and soulless films in existence .  however , director john ottman manages to make " urban legends : final cut " into one of the worst achievements of this godforsaken genre .  what was done with a sense of redemption for past failures and irony in " scream " , ottman takes seriously .  for that reason alone , it is worth a look , just to realize how bad a movie can be .  it's tough to find comparisons for such an achievement , and we have to dig in ancient history to find a movie that would match its intellect .  even movies like " lost in space " and " mission to mars " seem spectacular in its shadow .  we have not seen such waste of t !  ime and resources since " showgirls " ( 1995 ) .  no matter how hard i tried to find positive elements in this so called production , i came up with nothing , except the way the killer was dressed .  here i feel that i have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker and marie-sylvie deveu , that have wisely replaced the well known scream-mask with a very elegant fencing mask .  jennifer morrison ( " stir of echoes " ) is all right , and the other actors' best achievement is keeping a straight face when pronouncing the words from the script .  in fact the only thing that is terrifying about this film ( with the exception of its screenplay ) is its portray of film schools .  if these graduates will be the directors of the future , then hollywood's golden days are over .  rumors are already spreading through the internet that columbia tristar is already developing a third installment .  let's just hope and pray that it's just an urban legend .  
aspiring broadway composer robert ( aaron williams ) secretly carries a torch for his best friend , struggling actor marc ( michael shawn lucas ) .  the problem is , marc only has eyes for " perfect 10s , " which the geeky , insecure robert certainly is not .  meanwhile , marc's spoiled ( hetero ) female roommate , cynthia ( mara hobel ) , spends her days lying about their apartment and harrassing magazine editor tina brown .  writer-director victor mignatti's " very romantic comedy " ( as the ad campaign states ) is supposed to be ( pardon the pun ) a gay ol' romp , but it's hard to have much fun with these annoying , self-absorbed characters and their shallow personal problems : marc and cynthia have sitcom-level domestic " crises " ( such as trying to kill bugs--how hilarious ) ; robert and marc go to acting class ( how riveting ) ; the zaftig cynthia goes on eating binges ( how original ) .  but more than anything else , the three whine .  constantly .  marc whines about his turbulent romance with an apparent " 10 , " david ( hugh panaro ) , the hunky musician from across the way ; robert whines about not being able to find the right guy ; cynthia whines about having to find a job ( horrors ) .  the terrible trio whine their way to a happy ending that is wholly undeserved .  add in overly broad performances and some laughable lipsynching by panaro , and you're left with one astonishing piece of cinematic damage .  
synopsis : valerie , a high school junior who doesn't look a day under 22 , writes bad poetry , complains about how much she hates school , fantasizes about a young guy on trial for raping and murdering six women , chooses him as a pen pal , and plays hooky to see him in court .  after a jailbreak , the killer puts on big sunglasses , wears a half-buttoned jacket , and uses his fatal charm to go after valerie .  comments : " alan smithee " directed fatal charm , which should have been more appropriately titled " fatal bore " or " fatal crap " .  if you find out that a film you're about to see is directed by " alan smithee , " then you should seriously , seriously , seriously consider watching something , anything , else .   " alan smithee " is a pseudonym which a number of directors have used when they produce something really bad .  frankly , i'd be embarrassed if i had directed this turkey , so i think i understand why the director might have picked the " alan smithee " moniker for this film .  where to begin with this painfully poor thriller ?  let's start with the acting .  it's pretty bad .  amanda peterson plays valerie and shows at least some talent ( the rest of the cast don't ) , even though her performance isn't exactly stellar material .  she's also miscast ; she seems way too old to still have a year of high school to complete .  her scenes with valerie's mother , played by mary frann , are a joke .  the two look as though they're a couple of coworkers going out to lunch together , rather than a daughter with her mother who just doesn't understand .  christopher atkins , a handsome enough actor who plays the killer , adam , looks like a clown in the second half of fatal charm .  trying to appear malicious and dangerous , he wears large sunglasses and a half-buttoned jacket .  if disney decided to do a zany comedy caper about the unabomber , atkins would probably be a perfect candidate for the lead , but he doesn't cut it here .  early on in the movie , a number of scenes occurs in a courtroom .  outside of the laughably poor performances given by the actors portraying lawyers , the people sitting in the benches provide the silliest effort at drama in the film .  they constantly shift and turn and arc their heads in mock interest in what has got to be one of the worst perfomances that a large group of people have given at one time ever .  fatal charm's storyline , such as it is , inspires more yawns than thrills .  the script belabors a red herring , early on , about a second suspect who may have committed the murders for which adam ( atkins ) is charged with .  this suspect , however , turns up strangled and drowned halfway through the film : an obvious plot fault .  even for the idiots who didn't consider the movie's title as valerie and a blond newsreporter commented how innocent and charming the defendant seemed , it becomes quite obvious that adam is dangerous when the other suspect washes up .  so , the audience must wait ( if they haven't already stopped watching ) as the necessary details fall into place and the killer goes after the heroine in the drawn-out finale .  the video box for this dud describes fatal charm as an " erotic thriller " .  a thriller it isn't , and neither is it particularly erotic .  i can't imagine , if someone were in the mood for something " erotic , " that he'd be happy after watching this fluff .  a few erotic moments occur in the film ; they take place in a van with little lighting and are filmed out of focus ( see , they're supposed to be valerie's fantasies -- how creative ) .  on a personal note , i was disturbed by the ludicrous english literature class shown in this film which valerie had to suffer through .  it's no wonder why she hated high school so much .  as an instructor of english myself , i have a hard time accepting the fact that in a course emphasizing great literature , a teacher would stoop to reading a student's bad poetry ( of course , it's valerie's ) about boyfriends out loud and then embarassing its author in front of class with questions about the poem's inspiration .  i guess the public school system is still setting dubious standards for its students .  fatal charm won't charm anyone , unless there's someone that's charmed by boring , lifeless , insipid , suspenseless thrillers .  if you happen upon this turkey , just keep moving on .  
the catch phrase for disney's rocket man is one spoken by fred z . randall ( harland williams ) , the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes .   " it wasn't me ! " he proclaims over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others .  well when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is , williams can't take all the blame , but he sure can't justify himself with his own simple tag line either .  fred has dreamed of space travel since he was a young boy , turning the clothes dryer into a mock space shuttle and staring out wide-eyed at a poster of the earth .  as a 30-year-old , fred hasn't grown up much , but at least he's somewhat closer to his goal , now designing astronaut software for nasa .  when an astronaut for an upcoming mission to mars becomes injured , nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside and out to fill the void .   .   .  fred .  yes , although he's an obviously klutzy moron , nasa doesn't think twice about throwing him into a rigorous training program so he can assist one of the most important events the space program , and time itself , has ever known .  for the first part of the film , we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park . he laughs , he screams , but he never once breaks a sweat or views the preparation as anything more than child's play .  his passive approach to the program eventually leads to many record-breaking feats , much to the dismay of cocky counterpart , mission commander captain overbeck ( william sadler ) , who once held the records .  overbeck will regretfully accompany fred and two others to the red planet , one being astronaut julie ford ( the stupids' jessica lundy ) , and the other being a chimpanzee who is much more civilized than our antagonizing protagonist .  from here on out , we are subjected to one lame gag after another , dealing with snot , laxatives , and flatulence .  you know , standard kid movie material .  almost sounding like a poor james stewart impressionist , williams is awful in his first starring role .  we get the feeling that if jerry lewis and pee-wee herman were related and produced an inbred offspring , williams would be it .  while he's not as annoying as other actors who cater to zany , stupid comedy , he's just as unlikeable .  to say it more understandably , jim carrey might annoy you more , but this guy is even less funny .  why ?  because while he possesses the stupidness needed to pull off such a role , his performance is too understated and boring .  classic comedic dunces were generally oblivious to their own idiocy .  stan laurel , for example , was so innocent in all his trouble-making that we were immediately fond of him .  peter sellers , as inspector clouseau , was so self-assured and confident that when he did something as simple as trip , it was humor at it's best .  williams , on the other hand , can't garner the pity he needs to make us love him in all his anti-glory .  as for the rest of the cast , including some bigger names in smaller roles ( beau bridges and shelley duvall ) , nobody is worth watching whatsoever .  this is just another example of the fast-food equivalent of cinema : mass-produced , less than mediocre , over priced , and hard to stomach .  giving it one-and-a-half stars is * extremely * generous , but even i'll admit to laughing a few times .  the amazing thing is that even in a theater packed with little kids , laughter was something rarely heard - even from the children !  i must admit that it gave me more respect for the kids when they didn't crack up over every little thing .  then again , maybe they were asleep .  some people might think critics are harsh on kid movies , claiming adults aren't the targeted audience and therefore aren't meant to , and won't , enjoy them .  sadly , it's also true that kids will enjoy almost anything if it's presented right .  a two-hour still shot of a dog with a cartoonish voice over could entertain a lot of toddlers out there , but would that make it as artistic as beauty and the beast , which could easily do the same thing ?  and saying that a parent's perspective isn't important is quite a poor theory to have when they're the ones who take the kids to these films in the first place .  
synopsis : two con artists find the perfect patsy in harry ( woody harrelson ) - - an inept former journalist who trips and bumps his head into a post , tries to slap a girl and gets poked in the eye , has ill-timed fits of coughing , and fails at everything he does .  the story is told from harry's point of view .  harry always carries around a shot of whiskey although he swears he doesn't drink .  one day harry is approached by the con girl rhea ( elisabeth shue ) , who is similar to harry in that she carries around a cigarette but swears she doesn't smoke .  seduced , harry agrees to participate in a money-making scheme involving faking the kidnapping of odette ( chloe sevigny ) , the teenage daughter of a rich man .  turns out , it's all part of a needless , very puzzling , extremely elaborate and convoluted scheme ( it involves hiring special impersonators ) by two cons in order to fool harry , a hero who barely has the intellectual capacity of a wooden post .  when the 'kidnapped' odette is found dead , the clues point to harry as the kidnapper/murderer , and the police are hot on harry's trail .  harry suddenly realizes he has been framed while others have taken the ransom money .  can he get out of this mess ?  opinion : palmetto is a long , uninteresting film with all the wrong feel .  hero harry is an inept bungler who trips up often and consistently overestimates his own intelligence .  this farcical kind of character works best in an entertaining naked gun action comedy or dragnet spoof .  but palmetto is played like a dark , serious , detective noir drama , and watching harry's bumbling confidence amounts to an irritating distraction .  there's a lapse in concentration in the middle of the movie as the camera goes wild on breasts , buttocks , short skirts , colored painted nails , and women's legs .  even when the focus is supposedly on harry and his dilema , you can always notice the side of elizabeth shue's breast forming a prominent foreground .  towards the end , palmetto re-focuses on plot for the grand finale - - a confusing explanation involving impersonators , with woody harrelson handcuffed and suspended over a tub of acid as he hears the criminals' confession .  if you can imagine 'shemp' from the three stooges playing the detective hero of an hbo 'lingerie suspense' thriller , that's how out of synch this movie feels .  
fit for a ghoul's night out , fat girl stands cast iron firm with the simplistic , fatuous , built-in excuse that its woman director is baring the harsh sexual realities of adolescent girls .  being a boy , i might not understand female behavior and am unequipped to analyze this particular pseudo-feminist coming-of-age story .  fair enough .  i'll pretend to ignore the mannered posturing and health class 101 " this is a no-no " dialogue when older teenage boy coaxes younger teenage girl to let him fuck her up the ass , speaking variations on " it won't hurt ! "  for a scene that seems to last at least ten minutes .  this is done almost entirely in an unbroken master shot that suggests unimaginative camerawork more than unblinking voyeurism .  they dare you to look away , without possessing the courage of allowing the children to actually sound like children ( they're mouthpieces for writer-director catherine breillat's one-note clinical politics ) .  rather than show an even-handed evaluation of the rigors of hormonal change , breillat ( previously responsible for the unwatchable romance ) wants to indulge in her hour of hate .  life is pain , highness .  get used to it .  she'd find keen bedfellows in neil labute and todd solondz , other sultans of misanthropy who lack the balls to be earnest or honest .  for children , dealing with trauma and pain is complicated .  to bury that in sarcasm and academic theory feels cheap .  these would-be auteurs ( more like hauteurs ) haven't earned the right to display suffering because they don't layer it in emotional truth ( as mike leigh does throughout naked and david lynch in several key scenes of blue velvet ) .  of course , there i go again comparing her to all these ( better ) male directors .  i don't care .  gender be damned , she's borderline inept .  braced for a knee-jerk reaction from the art house crowd ( mortified shock or compulsory applause will suffice ) , writer-director catherine breillat may well accomplish her mission to get a rise out of people .  don't be fooled .  this grotesque oversimplification of awkward forays into passion may be quickly forgotten , remembered only as cold , boring , philosophically arid , and incompetently photographed .  the hyperviolent climactic sequence proves so extraordinarily misguided that i honestly wondered whether breillat had thrown in an impromptu dream sequence .  twelve years old , a bundle of dough with a sour pout , the superb ana ? s reboux plays the titular fat girl with a thousand yard stare and a frumpy insouciance .   ( her character is also named ana ? s . )  sitting at the table morosely slurping down a banana split , her presence is grounded and heartbreaking .  it's a pity breillat never finds anything for her to do other than get defensive against her evil storybook sister , 15-year old elena ( roxane mesquida ) , for bringing a transitory boyfriend home to their shared room .  in this summer cottage , ana ? s has no escape from her position as stoic bedside observer to elena's depressing confusion of cheap sex with romance .  the boy in question , a smug italian college kid named fernando ( libero de rienzo ) is a real piece of work , claiming that the experience is a declaration of love while begging for a blowjob .  ana ? s doesn't receive any warmth from her largely absent parents , who join elena in making fun of her hefty girth .  she finds pleasure in wandering the beach alone , singing songs to herself , and swimming in the pool kissing the metal railing and pretending that it's her paramour .  reboux commands the screen , but there's only so much a child actress can do recounting pretentious monologues to herself .  if one is inspired to rescue this young performer and place her in a better movie , at least she fares better than the other young talent asked to perform in intense love scenes that might feel justified if they weren't so dramatically misguided .  this 83-minute vignette is something of a horror show , but breillat saves her nastiest poison for the very end .  on the long ride home punctuated by an uncomfortable silence between family members , gigantic trucks swerve by as the hour grows late .  will mommy fall asleep at the wheel ?  perhaps .  or maybe there's something deadlier around the corner , lying in wait to pounce upon the unsuspecting fat girl .  what's more , she might even like it .  with the intent of being unfair and unpredictable , placing her heroine in the most diabolical of corners in order to face up to impending adulthood , breillat's extreme flourish of sadistic tawdriness reveals her as a master purveyor of contempt .  fat girl is a bitter pill indeed .  aka ? ma soeur !  screened at the 2001 new york film festival ( feature coming soon ) .  
i can imagine how good krippendorf's tribe must have looked on paper .  it does not surprise me in the least that a group of extremely talented actors , led by the great richard dreyfuss and a good director ( todd holland ) , all wanted to make this film .  in fact , it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorf's tribe as possible .  in retrospect , i can imagine how bad this film could have been .  i shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss .  dreyfuss plays james krippendorf , an anthropologist who is granted $100 , 000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea .  halfway into his two-year expedition , his wife ( apparently ) dies .  i say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established .  later , we find out that much of the grant money was spent on big-screen tvs and other such pleasures .  so , when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely , he decides to construct an elaborate lie .  he makes his own tribe , using his three children as actors in a video .  he simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe ( which he calls the shelmickedmu ) .  audiences at krippendorf's lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision .  and proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community .  like all films like this , the lie becomes more and more complex , and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero .  dreyfuss is a funny , talented man , and he is funny in this film .  he has lots of positive energy and , unlike most comical actors , really manages to play people like this realistically .  this film also requires a lot of physical humor that i've never seen dreyfuss perform , and he does a great job .  jenna elfman , who plays veronica mecilli , a scientist who wants in on krippendorf's work , is also very funny and appealing here .  and the kid actors are great , as well .  but we're talking about the script from hell .  this is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen .  but the ridiculousness of the story is not really what is so bad about it .  all the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew .  no , the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and mean-spirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched .  furthermore , the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless .  take , for instance , the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex .  they get all decked out in the tribe getup , complete with paint to darken their skin .  krippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe .  now , i saw this scene coming from a mile away , but i said to myself , " no , that would be far too tasteless .  there's no way they'll do that . . . oh  god ! "  they did do it .  it's there .  i was almost more appalled by the fact that this didn't bother the other audience members with whom i saw this film .  i found it deplorable .  and when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it , he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice .  the film is filled with scenes like these .  they not only insult the audience , but they insult the types of people that the film portrays .  it would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough to fool an entire community of scientists , yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon .  and watching dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining , but i think that most members of the on-screen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as he goes .  if i were an anthropologist , this film would insult me immensely .  moving right along , the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes .  sure , dreyfuss dressing up like a chief is really funny , and it allows for some entertaining scenes , but the heart of this material is deeply clueless as to the themes and thoughts that it provokes .  it is because of dreyfuss as an actor that i was able to watch this film .  his character here is not a good subject for a film because he is a shameless liar , and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does .  i suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied in this case , but for the purposes of good taste , i would have expected something .  no , this man sets a terrible example for his kids and colleagues , and the writer of the film ( charlie peters ) didn't include a single scene in which krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is very bad .  in fact , it's his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doing the wrong thing , and he continually shrugs off her warnings .  i suppose it's important to admit that this is a funny film .  dreyfuss and elfman , and many of the contrived and insulting scenes , add up to a picture that is anything but boring .  and if you're less serious than i , you probably will enjoy it .  i , however , can't get past these elements .  krippendorf's tribe is being marketed as a family comedy , but this is the kind of film that teaches the kids of our society faulty lessons that they shouldn't be learning .  with a little more insight into its story and themes , this could have been a good movie .  
starring william baldwin ; cindy crawford & steven berkoff all right , the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role .  not that cindy does that bad , it's just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy's extraordinary acting skills , but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation .  and in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty , but i'm sure that that is just a coincidence , no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet , well , that's just a happy coincidence .  sure .  william baldwin isn't a bad actor .  unfortunately , he just doesn't demonstrate it at all in this movie .  i'm not sure if that's because most of his lines were just so hokey , or if he was trying to make cindy's acting look good .  if it was the latter , it worked .  cindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie .  which is not to say that she doesn't have room for improvement .  although to be fair to cindy , her lines were kinda cheesy in places .  so right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford , arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet , chose for her foray into the world of cinema ?  well , i'm glad you asked that question .  cindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents .  why woud they target someone as likable as cindy , you ask ?  by the end of the movie you won't care .  the story is so contrived it isn't funny .  anyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house , without getting so much as a scratch i might add , she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin .  who's character , max kilpatric , a police detective , seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine ( my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagal's early films ) .  the point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin's characters of the run from these killer russians isn't all that bad of an idea , it's just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud .  the supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes .  if i was baldwin , i'd hope this film disappears .  as for crawford , she may indeed have some acting ability .  unfortunately , any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad .  this movie was obviously written with cindy in mind , since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks .  it's too bad they hadn't spent more time on a half decent plot , since ms . crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much .  unless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you .  
in 1989 , tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather .  was it " deep " ?  nope .  however it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up .  it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was " without the comic book uplift " of the indiana jones and superman pictures .  which was true .  if what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic man's escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place .  if those films were tom sawyer , then batman was huckleberry finn .  some critics ( glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone ) realized that it was something special ; mr . lovell gave it * * * 1/2 and wrote that " this is batman as batman should be . " ;  mr . travers called it one of the ten best films of the year .  the praise was deserved - from start to finish the film was enthralling , exciting , and superb in every respect .  there was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton .  the result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes .  the villains ( the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman ) take over , and our epectations are always left unfulfilled - when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman's nose he simply gets mad , and when we want catwoman to slither over batman's body she gets pushed off a building .  i admire mr . burton for trying to do more then entertain , but the result is a mess .  nothing works out as planned - it fails both to entertain and to enlighten .  hints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast .  alas , these are only hints .  there are , don't misunderstand me , several moments of cinematic genuis contained ; catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said ; christopher lloyd is trapped , by the penguin , within a giant cage ; a small basket is dropped into a large river ; but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis .  a weak followup , both career and sequel wise , batman returns is sometimes dazzling , but to often dissapointing .  
 " there will be another , " the ads for this sequel proclaimed , and why not ?  true , brandon lee is dead , but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994's the crow , anyway .  the idea of spinning artist james o'barr's original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie , taking its own righteous vengeance against the world .  given that basic framework , the story could move in any number of directions .  of course , it doesn't .  stubbornly , the crow : city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film , when lee's eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death .  i remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality .  in flashback , we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover , and then we watch in real-time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind .  it's loud and repetitive , true , a sadist's delight -- but it's also horrifying and fascinating .  city of angels gives us more of the same , but less skillfully .  there's an audience guaranteed for a film like this , although bad reviews and poor word-of-mouth will likely ensure that it won't be much of a success .  in fact , miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings .   ( i've never understood the reasoning behind this tactic , since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow . )  so much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup .  this time , ashe ( french-accented actor vincent perez ) is retrieved from his watery death ( he and his young son were shackled together , shot , and then thrown off a pier ) by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead .  perez might have some screen presence if he's given something to do with himself , but here he's simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face .  at first , he's shivery and frightened , but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave .  he's befriended by sarah ( mia kirshner ) , presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film .  kirshner , so beguiling in exotica , is here an exquisitely photographed blank .  tattooed with angels' wings , sarah is just about as lovely as women come , but she serves no purpose , not even as seductress .  the gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah ( richard brooks ) , but a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop , who plays a gaunt fellow named curve .  iggy , all bones , veins , and drawl , is the only one who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film .  like all good things here , he's dispatched too soon and without much imagination .  in the meantime , we're subjected to tedious glimpses of judah's compound , where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in s&m fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they weren't distinctly secondhand .  even the soundtrack is tired .  more than anything i've seen from hollywood lately , city of angels smacks baldly of product -- it's a movie with a lousy script but a great look .  critics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope , but his work isn't that bad per se .  he's got a good eye , and some intriguing visual ideas -- if anything , this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery .  his major stylistic failing is that he can't seem to direct an action scene , and the quick , nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie .  but as director , he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasn't , the performers who couldn't , and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved .  who bought david s . goyer's anemic script , anyway ?  the producers of this crow were either too dim to realize their story was doomed to be a hollow rehash , or too cynical to figure their audience would know the difference .  
i love movies .  i really do .  every time i watch great movies like goodfellas ( 1990 ) or raiders of the lost ark ( 1981 ) , a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent , skill and entertainment that is on display .  even lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1/3 ( 1994 ) or ghostbusters ii ( 1988 ) while not exactly brilliantly well made , are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value .  then there's my favourite martian , the exact opposite of what a movie should be : a hurried , poorly written and acted movie with one goal , to make money .  disney , ever since the lion king ( 1994 ) have lost their magic touch , but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk .  christopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front of t . v reporter's tim o'hara car ( daniels ) , and soon tim finds the martian in his home , trying to recover and fix his spaceship .  along with his 'zoot' spacesuit , voiced by wayne knight , must fix his spaceship before it explodes , and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public , firstly by o'hara , but later by rival t . v presenter brace channing ( hurley ) , by calling himself tim's 'uncle martin . '  'laughter' is supposed to arise from the 'comical' events , but never does .  many bad films have good intentions , but my favourite martian doesn't appear to try to provide any entertainment .  filled to the brim with wham bang special effects , my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy .  christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie , i've never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now .  jeff daniels plays 'staple nice guy' and his role is useless .  his performance is incredibly lazy , although his paperthin character doesn't deserve more than the performance he gives .  darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever , but her role is somewhat , erm , limited .  hurley mistakes 'acting' for 'shouting and looking like a twit' and wins the david wilcock award for 'most irritating , godawful performance in a moving picture . '  way to go liz !  for the supporting cast , disney manage to assemble every character actor out there , during the film i was going 'he was the guy in . . . ah . . er . . . '  before finally giving up and switching off .  another major setback is the staple 'comedy sidekick . '  unfortunately , the writers ( sherri stoner and deanna oliver , if anyone cares ) forget that a comedy sidekick needs to be 'funny . '  instead , they deliver zoot , the martians deeply unfunny sidekick .  although meant to be a manic character no doubt , every line that comes out of his 'neck' is a dud .  a real dud .  citizen kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester .  even the kids in the audience were insulted by this character : not one child even bothered to smirk .  it's a nice special effect , though .  another problems with this comedy are the gags themselves .  or rather , the lack of them .  my favourite martian reaches a new level of toilet humour : it goes past the bowl , down the pipe and into the sewer .  now , toilet humour can be funny , as dumb and dumber ( 1994 ) humorously showed .  but here , characters farting , belching and almost getting crapped on ( literally ) is not 'amusing . '  it's insulting .  there's one good gag right before the credits , but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued .  either that , or they were hoping that easy to please six year olds wouldn't mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes .  yes , men at work .  yowza !  the fact that a lot of money was pumped into this film , and that they actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more .  there are thousands of brilliant films out there that can't get distribution , yet trash like this gets released nation-wide with ease .  thankfully , as soon as it makes it's money , it will never be seen again , and my favourite martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the end of the movie : down the toilet .  
movie concepts are often pitched to producers with mathematical formulas involving successful films of the past .  so , undoubtedly one day someone said , " 'evolution ? '  it's 'ghostbusters' plus 'men in black' plus 'tremors . ' "  and so it is .  sum total none .  the alienbusting begins when a meteor lands in glen canyon , arizona .  community college science profs ira kane ( david duchovny ) and harry block ( orlando jones ) take some samples from the meteor and discover that one-celled organisms from inside it are evolving rapidly , doing in hours what took millions of years for life on earth .  just about the time i was wondering , " hey , doesn't the government usually come in and take over the whole area in these movies , " the government came in and took over the whole area .  the leader of the pack , gen . woodman ( ted levine ) , turns out to be an old nemesis of ira's , and ira and harry are blocked from doing further research .  meanwhile , the organisms continue to grow until they are large enough to start attacking people .  by this time , ira and harry have gained a friend in dr . allison reed ( julianne moore ) of the center for disease control .  a country club poolboy , wayne green ( seann william scott ) , has also attached himself to the merry band .  but can they find the means to stop the aliens in time ?  director ivan reitman seems to be revisiting his biggest hit , 1984's " ghostbusters , " but " evolution " falls miserably short .  one reason is readily apparent .   " ghostbusters " had three really funny guys as its scientists ( bill murray , dan aykroyd , and harold ramis ) , but " evolution " has one really funny guy ( orlando jones ) who can adlib and milk the comic potential of lines that prove useless in anyone else's hands .  for good measure , " ghostbusters " had the comic talents of rick moranis ; " evolution " offers seann william scott , who was much funnier in " american pie " and " road trip " than he is here .  scott has one amusing scene where he sings " you are so beautiful to me " to a dragon-like alien to draw it into a trap .  other than that , scott seems unable to make much of the thin material the writers gave him .  an actor in search of a forte , david duchovny looked for his gritty action hero side in " playing god " and his romantic side in " return to me . "  now he wants to find his wacky comedic talent ; what we all find is that he doesn't have any .  look for him to be back on tv in five years or so .  another sad case is julianne moore , who needs to be more selective about the offers she accepts .  she's a talented actress with an impressive list of credits and award nominations , so why is she trying to do slapstick comedy ?  her character has a tendency to trip over and bump into things , but the trait comes off as a pathetic plea for laughs .  the sole saving grace of the film is jones .  he's at the center of the movie's funniest scene -- where an alien bug invades harry's body and has to be pulled out through his ass .  jones is the only cast member who can take the comedic ball and run with it , but he can't carry the whole movie by himself .  he found himself in a similar situation in " the replacements , " where he was also the only comic talent in an ensemble cast .  jones will eventually find the project that will make him a major comedy star , but this isn't it .  
warning : spoilers are included in this review . . .  but it doesn't really make much of a difference .  deep impact begins the official summer movie season , and it also brings back memories of 1997 .  remember when dante's peak came out in february ?  a few months later , volcano was released .  the first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen .  the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent .  well , it's deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition .  this time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july .  of course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante's peak .  but while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film .  apparently many did , and it utterly baffles me .  to be completely honest , i haven't had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life .  volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch .  deep impact doesn't just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot .  the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters .  deep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 ) .  a line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above .  among these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) .  leo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds .  he races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident .  a year passes , and nothing is heard about it again .  we are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc .  she gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell ) .  she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie .  after talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help .  luckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain " ellie " that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film . . .  that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled ) .  before she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road .  they take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman ) .  beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference .  naturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question .  and so , yada yada yada , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive .  they announce a plan called " ark , " which is their only hope for survival .  a computer will select 800 , 000 people at random .  these people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won't kill off the entire human race .  after two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over .  the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning .  jenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom .  the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional .  it's a shame that nothing else is heartfelt .  now , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface .  the title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it !  by doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won't work .  director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show " er . "  her major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film .  well , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one .  suggestion to ms . leder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre .  much of the blame can be placed on leder directly , because the pace is disastrously off .  throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours ) .  it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time--it's that boring .  of course , leder isn't all to blame for it .  screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time .  what starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway ) .  chock full of cheesy one liners ( " you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! " )  and stupid characters , you might think we were back in the 70s again .  only one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while the rest are forgettable and boring .  and the main plot is so outrageous that you can't figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci-fi .  to put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation .  that's right , 80% miss , and 20% hit .  scenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic .  but the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening .  the concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that's forgiveable .  what isn't forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface .  give me a break , will ya ?  and of course , the much hyped collision of comet and earth .  well , it is far from spectacular , and it makes independence day look brilliant .  the water rushing towards the land is effective , but once it hits the continent , the effects turn ridiculous .  cgi water is used , and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks .  in fact , i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days .  just when we think visual effects can't be improved , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be .  one thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder's direction , which also influences the actors .  leder loves to show the actors' faces before and during moments of terror .  this reminded me of another action director , renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger ) .  but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations .  leder likes to flaunt people's fears via their faces , but instead of coming off as sympathetic , leder seems more of a sadist .  one moment has an astronaut flying off into space .  this should be enough to warrant a response from the audience , but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person's face while drifting into space .  this is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience , and i , for one , am not going to be fooled .  on another note , leder's film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts .  the pace does pick up , and some very emotional moments are shown .  then again , when you watch people cry for their loved ones , it's obvious it will be emotional .  it's mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into " feeling " for the characters , but it didn't work for me .  but anyway , the actors do as much as they can with what they are given .  t ? a leoni ( bad boys , tv's " the naked truth " ) is the best of the film , and she is given the meatiest role .  her character is made stronger by leoni's presence , and we grow to care for her .  robert duvall is energetic and fun to watch , but his character is turned into shreds by the plot .  elijah wood also comes off rather successfully , but he still hasn't had many good roles ( wood , stick to drama !  you are too talented for this stuff ) .  vanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable , and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen .  maximilian schell is distracting , but he does provide some nice humor .  morgan freeman has been infinitely better than this , and gives one of his most shallow performances to date ( which is quite remarkable for him ) .  leelee sobieski could have been better , but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character .  a special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby .  eldard is good in his role , but is limited by the plot .  crosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv's " star trek : the next generation . "  seeing her was one of the highlights of the film .  overall , a very talented cast virtually wasted .  deep impact is rated pg-13 for disaster related elements and brief language .  this is one of the worst films of the year , and if it is any omen of things to come , this summer could be one of the worst ever .  luckily , the x-files movie is coming up , and hopefully armageddon will be more successful .  it's a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn't worth much .  costing nearly $75 million , with special effects done by the illustrious ilm ( which is a huge shocker ) , and with a score composed by oscar-winner james horner ( titanic ) , one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience .  well , it's not .  when the comet does hit the earth , you almost wish it could just take this film along with it .  
for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo ( the killer , hard boiled , face off ) appears to have made an exciting , elegant , charming spy thriller , kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american ( read : unsophisticated ) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them .  sadly , as the picture progresses , the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up , two-hour long episode of magyuver .  and not a particularly good one at that .  what went wrong ?  mi2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe that it'll soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise's firing gun just so they can die really cool .  early on , during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) and nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) , woo works some of his trademark magic .  in one hypnotic , though completely inexplicable sequence , the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other's eyes with come hither sexuality ? ? ? just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance , coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff .  prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain , sans scaffolding , then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another .  why ?  i haven't the foggiest .  i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply .  with mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine , the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects .  it's possible that these " spies " could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off , though of course this is never explored .  the scenes i've described are really only included to titillate , not to give any insight into character .  god forbid .  woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic , but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial-like visuals .  still in terms of crackerjack eye candy , the opening has much to cherish .  cruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is ) .  between the frantic dancing , woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact .  the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way , yet it has style and something of soul , and woo casts a bit of a spell on us .  sure it's all smoke and mirrors , but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product .  thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that's about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight .  they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres .  newton bats her eyes flirtatiously .  cruise grins a little too slyly .  the cruise character , ethan hunt , has been drastically altered since the first film .  here cruise plays him more as a hip , sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1 .  he's cool and dashing , which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut ( which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film ) , and blustered his way through magnolia ( quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90's ) .  sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise's initial " i'm the man ! "  charm and more slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug .  mi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act , which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won't stop .  the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun fight in the film ) , which really should be unheard of in a john woo film , but alas this particular battle could've been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi ( of course excepting the " symbolic " pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture ) .  we've all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand .  it isn't done any differently here .  the action is pure hard target \ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind .  he's cool for sure but he's made to be as empty as the movie .  the actor isn't used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment , be it during a gunfight , before one or after one .  when he's not beaming away , he's staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell , but woo's editing seriously undermines the effort .  he fetishizes cruise's angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof .  i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he's really austin powers .  in a classic woo action moment , ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin-up boy angel of death .  the gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual ( one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise , basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does ) .  the lead bad guy ( played by the appropriately british dougray scott ) and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken ? ? ? on motorcycles .  though instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment , the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug , only to fly about a hundred feet ( still in bear hug position ) , land on a beach below and begin a mano-e-mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a " so you thought i was dead . . . " .  not to worry , cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat .  what a hero !  you may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2's plot .  my reasoning is simple : i'm not sure of any good it would do .  the film itself has absolutely no concern with story , only with hurtling forth to the next " special " effect .  i wasn't kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video .  nobody will go to this for the plot , and if they do they'll surely regret it .  as summer movies evolve ( or devolve ) character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing .  in mi , the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma's ( that film's director ) stylistic flourishes , while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo's non-stop masturbatory pandemonium .  it's irrelevant in every sense , as is character .  all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors .  
nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air .  the opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl .  the prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met .  if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should .  cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained .  and thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona's h . i . mcdonnough .  cage should have known what he was getting himself into .  he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there's one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it's that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production .  the critical difference between the rock and con air is cage's performance .  in the rock , cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time .  that sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness .  while the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage's goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact .  audiences , too , should know what they're getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production .  in fact , the marketing people are counting on it .  no one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded .  director simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab's soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) .  what he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense .  a bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock's notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely .  if either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air's creepiest set-up .  at a desert stop for the plane-load of convicts , serial killer garland greene ( steve buscemi ) wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool .  their tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) .  in fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts .  it is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance .  while malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack ( as a u . s . marshal ) goes for earnest , cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep .  his recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape , his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies .  it doesn't bode well for cage's appearance in face/off later this month ; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over .  there's a word for people like you , nicolas .  that word is called recidivist . . . repeat  offender .  
one of these days , i'll make good on my promise never to rent another abel ferrara movie .  king of new york and body snatchers notwithstanding ( and bad lieutenant is only fit for a single , emotive viewing ) , his exploitation flicks have fallen into a rut of hoary art-house trappings .  it's a perfume-drenched , coke-addled visit to the seedy pornography shop , where beautiful models ( no , hookers -- no , courtesans ) usher you through the silk curtains .  ferrara's only consistently smart move has been casting christopher walken over and over again , since walken can make a good movie great and a loathsome movie durable whenever he's onscreen .  his 8-minute scene in the addiction is the saving grace of that otherwise abysmal , unwatchable , and pretentious failure .  when he starts talking about his vampiric bowel movements , or questions whether lili taylor has ever read naked lunch , there's a much-needed dose of humor in an otherwise terminally unfunny affair .  you know those gothic club kids who are too cool to smile and let you know they're actually having fun ?  the addiction is that movie .  walken , sadly , does not appear in the blackout .  the central role of matty , a junkie film star whose lightning paced hollywood life among the beautiful people is inevitably leading to his destruction , is played by matthew modine ( who takes what he can get after cutthroat island ) .  much like the protagonists of michelangelo antonioni's terminally bored cultural elite , matty is involved in a bitter pill " relationship " with high fashioned model annie ( at least i think she's a model . )  matty's lady is played by french actress b ? atrice dalle , arrested twice for cocaine possession during filming of the blackout -- not that you needed to know that , but it lends credence to the idea that ferrara's entire oeuvre has been filmed in a fucking blackout .  no kidding .  requiem for a dream has nothing on the junkie presentations seen in ferrara's movies and his controversial urban lifestyle .  matty and annie struggle over her decision to have an abortion without consulting him .  no doubt , he was off chasing the dragon .  in his despair , matty indulges in a chemical induced weekend of debauchery , tooling around the streets of miami with video filmmaker mickey wayne ( dennis hopper , in full " dirty ol' man " mold smacking models on the ass and telling them to spread their legs .  wider ! )  toward the end of the night , they pick up a teenage waitress also named annie ( sarah lassez ) , start shooting a hastily improvised sexual scene , then matty thankfully blacks out .  something happened that night which haunts him throughout the rest of the movie , and it's exactly what you think it was .  suffice to say , there's some confusion over whether he killed annie one or annie two , or anyone at all .  the blackout is typical ferrara : no plot to speak of , plenty of raunch , and horribly vogue images of matthew modine downing a bottle of jack daniels and a beer while wrapping himself in a see-through curtain in his hotel room by the sea , by the sea , by the beautiful sea .  cinematographer ken kelsch finds inconsistent glory in alternating gorgeous painterly sunsets with docu-style sleaze ( and we're back to dennis hopper leering at girls in bathing suits .   " yeah ! ! !  yeah ! ! !  arrrghhh ! "  says mr . hopper .  dirty old sod . )  it's compulsive viewing in a tacky sort of way , leading to a ridiculous climax where modine seizes control of his destiny .  how's that for cryptic ?  never fear -- ferrara finds time for some female full frontal nudity to remind us what he's all about .  i can picture it now .   " take off yer clothes , kid -- it's essential to depict the inner maelstrom of my central protagonist , and you're his visual id .  you're the soul , the heart , the bloodstream of the picture .  take it off !  take it all off ! ! !  ha ha ha ! "  friggin' vampire .  yeah , you , ferrara .  a final word about matthew modine : he's actually a fine actor when properly cast , but there's something too squeaky-clean in his demeanor .  he's ideally suited for sarcastic men in tightly controlled situations , such as his private joker in full metal jacket or the time-bomb nebbish in short cuts ( who is every bit as superb as julianne moore in that famous scene , though no one seems to notice him ) .  [he was in that scene ?  -ed . ]  here , he's asked to let it all hang out , sporting a three-day stubble and oily bangs .  he throws around furniture like stanley kowalski , but it's somehow lacking .  modine lacks the feral intensity of brando , entirely miscast in ferrara's flesh fair .  better luck next time , matt .  someday , you'll be forgiven for cutthroat island , which wasn't really your fault in the first place .  maybe atom egoyan will find a place for you somewhere , and all will once again be well in your world .  
how do films like mouse hunt get into theatres ?  isn't there a law or something ?  this diabolical load of claptrap from steven speilberg's dreamworks studio is hollywood family fare at its deadly worst .  mouse hunt takes the bare threads of a plot and tries to prop it up with overacting and flat-out stupid slapstick that makes comedies like jingle all the way look decent by comparison .  writer adam rifkin and director gore verbinski are the names chiefly responsible for this swill .  the plot , for what its worth , concerns two brothers ( nathan lane and an appalling lee evens ) who inherit a poorly run string factory and a seemingly worthless house from their eccentric father .  deciding to check out the long-abandoned house , they soon learn that it's worth a fortune and set about selling it in auction to the highest bidder .  but battling them at every turn is a very smart mouse , happy with his run-down little abode and wanting it to stay that way .  the story alternates between unfunny scenes of the brothers bickering over what to do with their inheritance and endless action sequences as the two take on their increasingly determined furry foe .  whatever promise the film starts with soon deteriorates into boring dialogue , terrible overacting , and increasingly uninspired slapstick that becomes all sound and fury , signifying nothing .  the script becomes so unspeakably bad that the best line poor lee evens can utter after another run in with the rodent is : " i hate that mouse " .  oh cringe !  this is home alone all over again , and ten times worse .  one touching scene early on is worth mentioning .  we follow the mouse through a maze of walls and pipes until he arrives at his makeshift abode somewhere in a wall .  he jumps into a tiny bed , pulls up a makeshift sheet and snuggles up to sleep , seemingly happy and just wanting to be left alone .  it's a magical little moment in an otherwise soulless film .  a message to speilberg : if you want dreamworks to be associated with some kind of artistic credibility , then either give all concerned in mouse hunt a swift kick up the arse or hire yourself some decent writers and directors .  this kind of rubbish will just not do at all .  
can you say " dated " ?  you can if you've seen rosemary's baby which , like the exorcist , was a thrilling horror film in its time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release .   " mystery science theater 3000 " has skewered the bad films of the past , but let me tell you , it could do a number on the " good " ones too .  rosemary's baby stars mia farrow ( from the time she was actually good-looking ) as an innocent housewife and her not-so-innocent husband ( john cassavettes ) , an actor who takes an easy , albeit evil , road to success .  it all seems so harmless in the beginning .  mia and john move into an apartment where several past murders have been committed .   ( there's also a skull in the living room , but it's only for decoration . )  their elderly neighbors pop in for a housewarming .  all's well for about the first hour of this slow-moving film , until mia eats some of the neighbors' chocolate mousse and passes out .  when she comes to , she finds herself in a darkened room with a bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and a big , evil man raping her -- a foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen .  it seems like a dream and , when she finds herself pregnant , she almost forgets about it .  and everyone's helping with the pregnancy .  the neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions for her to drink , a good-luck charm for her to wear around her neck , and the name of an obstetrician who's been in the business 66 . 6  years .  meanwhile , mia begins having chronic stomach pains and losing a lot of weight .  before too long she looks just like the lead singer of the cranberries .  that's when you know your health's failing .  the only person in the movie who's the least bit suspicious of all this is an old friend ( maurice evans ) who calls mia up to give her the bad news -- and immediately falls into a coma .  by about the two-hour mark i felt the same way .  rosemary's baby is way too long , and leads up to a payoff that's about as boring and laughable as the rest of the movie .  i guess someone put a spell on this movie .  
ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film ; i have a problem even regarding it as a film .  it's more of a show , a big commercial for ted turner's world championship wrestling ( wcw ) .  the movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page , goldberg , and sting .  the story is very minimal and basic .  there are these two guys , gordy ( david arquette ) and sean ( scott caan ) .  they are two twenty-something wrestling fans from wyoming .  when they go to a live event for the big match up , there favorite wrestler jimmy king ( oliver platt ) is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus ( joe pantoliano ) .  gordy and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus' plans .  on the way , they meet some people , have some fun , and clean up some port-o-potties .  sounds great huh , well it's not .  the movie makes many attempts at humor , only a few of them work .  the jokes that make you laugh , however , do not outnumber the film's many duds .  there is a funny repertoire between arquette and a convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa .  the cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back .  i especially enjoyed one version in which they have a wrestling match and arquette's tag team partner is 'macho man' randy savage .  they wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor .  the other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan .  mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl , the cheerleaders of the wcw .  she becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice , funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan's breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face .  now what didn't work in this movie ?  that would be the rest of it .  the flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets .  the two lead characters work for a port-o-potty cleaning company and when they crash the truck , the excrements spill all over the road .  it's not funny ; it's pathetic and brainless .  the film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way .  i watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie .  the main characters in the film actually get to wrestle , like that would happen to any fan , especially to 2 that stalk a wrestler and sneak him back onto set .  also , i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily ; they just walked right in .  i like wrestling .  i watch it at home and laugh .  it's continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldn't watch it .  this movie wasn't even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv .  the only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew .  the funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn and chris benoit have left wcw for more money but are still featured in the film prominently .  the movie was too dim-witted to be funny .  it is possibly the most useless and under-developed film ever .  a recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film , detroit rock city .  that movie was interesting , well done and continuously funny unlike this film .  the acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh .  now that the scream trilogy is over , arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this and be a spokesman in those dumb 1-800-call-att ads .  at least he has a hot wife in courtney cox .  he's in the funny parts of the film but there aren't enough to make him look good .  the music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock's " bawitdaba " and " cowboy " .  martin landau has a great cameo as a classic , hard-nosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne .  script is important to a film but this piece of crap could have been made with a couple of scribblings on a napkin .  a fan of the wrestlers who are featured in the film probably wrote it .  at times the movie even tries to show wrestling as real .  the wrestlers form alliances , go to people's houses and beat them up .  it's utterly ridiculous .  the whole film was a wasteful , dumfounding experience .  the movie was made to pay homage to the fans , telling them things that made wrestling , not the wrestlers .  the wrestlers are making more money to make a movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying 5 dollars to see a potty-humor movie .  the wcw sucks and this movie is just a pathetic two-hour commercial to watch it .  if you're going to watch wrestling watch wwf , it's actually entertaining .  the wrestling is betters , they're funnier , more diverse , and have better entrance themes .  oh and the girls are hotter .  is this what movies have become , 2 hour-long commercials that you have to pay to see ?  don't waste your money .  
if the 70's nostalgia didn't make you feel old , the 80's nostalgia is bound to .  one of the latter set , " the wedding singer , " seems to be written by someone who did not experience the 1980's directly but only read about them in an article in parade magazine .  the wacky fashions are here .   .   .  and the music .   .   .  and references aplenty to celebrities and signs of the times , but it all seems tediously-and too obviously-inserted for the didn't-we-dress-funny-back-then chuckle .  the plot is standard romantic comedy with nothing original : robbie ( adam sandler ) is a wedding singer ; julia ( drew barrymore ) waits tables at weddings .  both are engaged ; however , robbie's fiance ( angela featherstone ) dumps him at the altar , and julia's fiance ( matthew glave ) is a skirt-chasing speculator in junk bonds .  robbie and julia go through the expected ups-and-downs as they realize they were meant to be together .  i'll fess up-i've never found adam sandler funny .  whatever his appeal is , i've missed it .   ( other comedians i don't get include pauly shore and pee wee herman-make your own judgments ) .  the stupidity and artificiality of the whole project is summarized in a cameo by billy idol as himself .  idol looks like hell , and the ravages of his lifestyle are barely concealed by thick makeup .  he's mocked by a photo of his younger self on a rolling stone cover in the same scene .  we're not supposed to notice that , and we're not supposed to notice how silly it is that billy idol suddenly appears to play fairy godmother to robbie .  other cameos , by steve buscemi and jon lovitz , provide the only real laughs in the movie .  lovitz is especially good , playing a rival wedding singer plotting with the mania of a bond villain to take advantage of robbie's post-break-up depression .  
one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often-acclaimed director sidney lumet's " gloria , " a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film , had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre .  suddenly , i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before , i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in .  when a movie is over , aren't we supposed to think about it for a while , and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with ?  i thought so , but , for one , i saw this particular picture by myself , and #2 , even if i had been with someone there wouldn't have been anything to talk about in the first place .  to be sure , " gloria " begins with a stirring , rather poignant prologue in which a seven-year-old boy's family is brutally gunned down by mobsters , in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it .  right before the men broke in , of course , his father gave him the disc to escape with .  eventually , the boy , named nicky nunez ( jean-luke figueroa ) , is caught by the mobsters , and taken back to their apartment .  meanwhile , gloria ( sharon stone ) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didn't commit and returns to her ex-boyfriend ( jeremy northam ) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime .  when he refuses to give it to her , and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky , she leaves with him in order to save his life , but not before holding the men at gunpoint , stealing all of their money , and forcing them to strip nude .  gloria is the type of fast-talking , smart-mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people , and she never expected to be stuck with a kid , but she has a heart of gold ( don't they always in this type of movie ) and is only trying to protect the boy , whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with .  the previous incarnation of " gloria " by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands , remains unseen by me , but was no doubt superior , even though i can't really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one , regardless of the director or stars .  there is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original , but the film itself is simply lifeless , with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn't completely unbearable to watch .  i liked , for example , a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at , and keeps turning the car around , then driving a little ways , then slamming on the brakes and turning around again .  these bright moments , however , appear long and far between , and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria , which is both painfully predictable and by-the-numbers .  throughout , my mind was repeatedly asking the question , " who really cares ? "  as gloria , sharon stone has adopted an over-the-top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn't sound realistic at all .  in the beginning , in fact , i was amazed at how amateurish stone's performance was , but as the film progressed she got better .  although not one of her better turns , stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored .  jean-luke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag .  all other actors who appeared were considerably wasted , none more than cathy moriarty , an entertaining actress in her own right , who is billed fourth and has all of one scene , as gloria's friend whom she turns to for help .  sony , the studio that released " gloria , " obviously does not have any faith in the film , and i don't blame them .  they declined to screen the picture for critics , which is never a good sign , particularly with the high-profile people involved .  although how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is ( just look at the spectacular " in dreams , " which failed to even make the top 10 last week ) , i have a suspicion " gloria " is going to vanish from theaters faster than " ishtar , " judging from the opening night 7 : 00 p . m . showing i saw it at , where there were about ten to fifteen people present , counting myself .  although stone can be an impressive actress ( just watch her in 1995's " casino " or 1996's " last dance " if you don't believe me ) and sidney lumet can be a respectable director , there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of " gloria " was worth remaking or , for that matter , why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful .  
the most absurd remake of 1998 ?  it's a toss up between gus van sant's psycho and mighty joe young , the new disney picture based on the old rko picture .   ( i knew i was in trouble when a polished , computer-generated version of that famous rko logo appeared before the head credits . )  there is no great demand for another giant ape movie-make that ape movie , period .   ( witness the quick deaths of buddy , born to be wild and congo . )  and while this latest entry is inoffensive and watchable , it's also an assembly line product through and through , lacking the charm and unpredictability of the jungle serials that partly inspired it .  theron is jill young : as a young girl in the wilds of africa , she befriended a baby gorilla after both their mothers were slain by poachers .  that baby gorilla ( nicknamed joe ) grows to immense proportions , and adult jill basically bides her time looking after him , playing hide and seek with him and guarding him against poachers .  enter conservationist greg ( paxton ) , who convinces jill to move with joe to california , where they can protect him better in a controlled environment .  joe is restless at first ; no sooner does he finally settle in to the new place than those nasty poachers show up in l . a . , plotting joe's demise .  suffice it to say , the movie could have been called " joe : ape in the city . "  theron ( so good in devil's advocate ) and paxton ( so good in the recent a simple plan ) are fine actors , but not fine enough to transcend the material , a paint-by-numbers script from the hack writers of superman iv and mercury rising .  the plot arguably borrows more from steven spielberg's the lost world than the 1949 original , with the computer-generated t-rex-i mean , joe-wreaking havoc on the busy streets for an encore ; the storytelling becomes especially lazy during this final third , with jill shouting , " look , joe's headed for the movie theatre ! "  followed by a shot of joe scaling mann's chinese theater ; a moment later , jill shouts again something like " look , joe's headed for an amusement park ! " and what do you know , there's joe at the pallisades carnival , scaring the bejesus out of innocent thrillseekers .  the seams of last-minute edits to mighty joe young show-unrelated scenes are patched together with quick dissolves .  the movie sure feels uneven , regardless : act two is underdeveloped , while a little of joe smashing cars in act three goes a long , long way .  underwood ( tremors , speechless ) was perhaps not the director for the job ; even the plentiful , untamed landscape looks dull in his hands .   ( capturing the beauty of nature requires more than his point and shoot style . )  i did enjoy certain sequences , especially the demoliton of a black-tie dinner sequence ; and the prologue , however implausible , is touching .   ( as a tyke , joe acts just like e . t . ) rick baker's make-up effects and puppetry are outstanding , the real star of the show-yet , for all its technical flawlessness , the creature remains too grumpy and homicidal to love .   ( his facial expressions are variations on a scowl . )  to be fair , i saw mighty joe young in a cinema packed with wailing children-it's a wonder i was able to decipher the dialogue .  it's certainly not a film for very young kids-intense fighting scenes may scare them , while any time joe's not on camera may bore them to tears .   ( note : older boys are more likely to be dazzled by theron's colourful array of tank tops . )  i suspect bland mighty joe young is passable entertainment for a family outing , but they sure don't make ? em like they used to .  
what happens when you put martin lawrence in a fat suit in real life ?  you get martin lawrence in a coma ( the comedian thought he was getting fat , so he put on numerous layers of heavy clothing and went jogging in 100 degree heat , ending up in a coma ) .  so what happens when you put martin lawrence in a fat suit in the movies ?  you get an audience in a coma .  in big momma's house , lawrence plays a fbi agent who's a master of disguises .  when a naughty , naughty man escapes from jail and seeks out his former girlfriend ( the very sexy nia long . . .  the only thing worth looking at in this movie ) , she flees to georgia to stay with her rather large southern aunt " big momma " ( ella mitchell ) .  the fbi follows her in order to recover the large sum of money stolen in the bank robbery that sent the naughty man to jail .  however , big momma is called away on an emergency .  sensing that they could lose their only chance to capture the criminal , lawrence goes undercover as big momma .  and let the comedy begin !  big momma's house is the definition of a " gimmick " movie if there ever was one .  the plot can basically be summed up as " martin lawrence dresses up as a fat woman " . . .  and even that description is too wordy .  you can just see this script plotted out on a chalkboard with martin lawrence/fat woman in the middle of the board with a big circle around it , and all sorts of clich ? d , " humorous " situations pointing to it .  fat woman plays basketball !  fat woman takes a dump !  fat woman kung fu !  well they left one off the board . . .  movie critic slips into coma !  paul giamatti ( private parts , the negotiator ) plays lawrence's partner and as much as i enjoy his work , even he can't inject life into this lifeless comedy .  hell , the greatest performers on the planet couldn't make this material work . . .  it's just that awful .  
plot : token director alan smithee steals the only copy of his film " trio " from the studio , after they complete the " final cut " without him .  he threatens to burn the film reel if they do not allow him to keep his vision .  critique : wow .  i really can't remember the last time a movie sucked on so many levels !  the " comedy " in this film is pathetic , obvious and dated ( oj simpson jokes galore ) .  the plot is uninteresting , boring and bad .  the structure of the film is annoying , repetitive and pretentious .  the acting is pretty bad , especially jackie chan , who can't act to save his life .  the cameos are lame and seem forced , and the ending blows chunks .  all in all , this movie believes itself to be a clever , humorous and edgy look behind the closed doors of hollywood , but comes across as a boring , stupid and completely unentertaining piece of shite .  i love to see movies about hollywood shenanigans , but this one bites the big one .  see it if you like to watch really bad movies , otherwise skip it , because it will just have you hating every star that makes an appearance in it .  luckily for us all , this mess only lasts about 80 minutes , and miramax honcho harvey weinstein plays a lead-faced detective .  by the way , is there any reason why the studio or the producer couldn't have cut another version of the film by the way of all the filmed stock that was left over ?  who knows , who cares , this " satire " sucks the bag .  little known facts about this film and its stars : ironically , the original director of this film , arthur hiller , also requested his name be taken off the credits and replaced by the dga's alan smithee moniker .  this was after the film's production company , cinergi pictures , preferred the cut made by producer/writer joe eszterhas to his .  the original script of this film included arnold schwarzenegger and bruce willis .  eszterhas announced through the media during post-production that cinergi pictures didn't have the money to pay for soundtrack .  he said that he would finance the soundtrack from his own money and asked to submit tracks for it to him .  he received 9 , 200 cds and cassettes from mostly unknown and unsigned artists , listened to all that was sent ( at least a couple of tracks from each record ) and compiled the soundtrack .  this film practically swept the " razzie awards " in 1999 , given out to the worst of all movie categories of the year , with no less than the " worst picture " award , the " worst screenplay " ( joe eszterhas ) , the " worst supporting actor " ( joe eszterhas ) , the " worst new star " ( joe eszterhas tied with jerry springer ) and the " worst original song " ( " i wanna be mike ovitz ! "  as written by joe eszterhas ) .  
susan granger's review of " the watcher " ( universal )  just what we need : another lurid , trashy serial killer saga .  this time , keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in a gruesome ticking-clock cat-and-mouse game with james spader , a burnt-out fbi agent who has suffered a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd .  to taunt spader , who has relocated to chicago , reeves packs up his trusty piano wire and moves too .  before long , he starts mailing photographs of the lonely , unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims , challenging spader , along with the chicago police department , to stop him within 24 hours before he strikes again .  in the midst of this murderous frenzy , there's spader's psychologist , played by marisa tomei , who is even less convincing as a medical professional than jennifer lopez in " the cell . "  writers david elliot , clay ayers and darcy meyers , along with first-time director joe charbanic ( helmer of music videos for reeves' band dogstar ) , dwell on the warped thrill of the methodology and the chase , revealing , early on , exactly whodunit since the killer says he and the cop " need each other to give meaning to our lives . "  plus , as reeves explains , " we're all stacked right on top of each other , but we don't notice each other any more . "  after that , it's all sound effects and tricky camera-work , along with a muddled , discordant soundtrack .  james spader's acting technique can be described as 'wooden deadpan' while keanu reeves maintains his perpetually monotone 'dude' persona which sometimes works , sometimes doesn't .  chris ellis , as spader's self-important colleague , is the only cast member who manages to be convincing .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " the watcher " is an appallingly awful , amateurish 2 . the real torture is watching it .  
not so long ago , men by the names of peckinpah , ford , leone , and eastwood made westerns .  real westerns .  these were some of the best films of the twentieth century .  those days are gone .  now we have crap like wild wild west to pass for the western .  and that record is not improved with the unbearable tale of american outlaws .  outlaws is yet another re-telling of the jesse james legend , courtesy of b-movie king james g . robinson ( producer of such classics as wrongfully accused and chill factor ) .  delayed since the spring , this version stars the irish hunka hunka burning love colin farrell ( the best part of schumacher's tigerland ) as the bad-ass jesse james .  alas , any sense of his character has been left on the ranch , leaving us with only cute chicks like ali larter ( minus the whipped cream ) to watch .  the spin this time around : fresh from serving as southern militiamen in the civil war , jesse james ( farrell ) , his brother frank ( gabriel macht ) , and his pal cole younger ( scott caan ) lay down their arms and head home to missouri to tend the family farms after the war has ended .  but trouble is brewing in their small town of liberty when evil railroad baron thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ) and his cronies rollin parker ( terry o'quinn ) and allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) demand the boys turn over their lands to the railroads .  the jameses and the youngers then join forces to fight the railroad -- by robbing banks up and down missouri , thus cutting off the railroad's financial surplus and playing robin hood to the local people .  along the way , the boys squabble over who's the cutest of the gang , who's the most popular cowboy in the gang , and who ought to go on mtv's total request live .  they rob numerous banks with identical interiors , always with the kindest of hearts , strutting in their grungy dusters as moby songs play in the background .  the witty banter they share could be plastered within a hallmark card .  the biggest disappointment here lies in the acting of colin farrell .  after a great job in tigerland , farrell walks through this role easier then nicolas cage in gone in 60 seconds .  and his american accent rivals richard gere's irish accent in the jackal .  combined with feeling like bonanza : the teen years , this homogenized production ( toned down to get the ever-popular pg-13 rating ) gives us an invincible jesse james that quickly grows tiresome and boring .  the unbearable villains courtesy of timothy dalton and thaddeus rains spend the entire film proclaiming that everyone should be hanged , sucking out any energy left in the film .  not to mention : the real story of jesse james and his gang bears no resemblance to the plot of american outlaws .  instead , the movie is full of old , outrageous tales about the wild west -- tales which went out of style in 5-cent magazines about a century ago .  
this is one of the worst big-screen film experiences i've had for a while .  with this film , plus `showgirls' and `basic instinct' , paul verhoeven has stamped himself as currently one of the worst blockbuster directors .  his celebrated film `total recall' was ? i admit ? successfully scripted , but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws .  obviously nobody wanted to invest too much money in a production from someone like verhoeven , the result being that much of the special effects in `starship' seemed fake .  but not everything bad in the film was the director's fault , even though he was one of the guys who employed the actors .  it is surprising that none of the actors received nominations for the razzie awards ( i expected five for the acting categories ) .  casserole vanity devoid , dense ribald , dingy miasma , and jackass bushy are in serious need of acting school .  no , they have to pass primary school drama classes first .  while `total' was written well , `starship' is purely pathetic .  all right , it is supposed to be a fast-paced entertainment film , and you're supposed to turn off your intellect ( completely ) and enjoy the action sequences and special effects ( that is , guts and gore ) .  as a matter of fact , i found the activity incredibly boring , a complete waste of more than two hours .  half of the film was a bad episode of `beverly hills 90210' ( dina meyer was in " beverly hills " ) , while another quarter was simply nothing ( things like presenting irrelevant information in an irritating way on the web ) , and the rest was a display of humans fighting computer-generated images .  the battles were all the same ? jumping around , shoot or get stabbed ? and on barren planets that only had giant insects .  there weren't even any stunts , which i consider slightly more exciting than pictures running around .  i wonder what the insects eat , if there's nothing but them on the planets ?  there is so much laughable treatment in this film , and it is frankly not amusing when jokes are intended .  this type of story is obviously aimed at 10-year-olds , who can't see it anyway because of the violence and some sexuality .  but then , there are always 16-year-olds who have that frame of mind .  the pointless plot begins when johnny's ( vanity devoid ) girlfriend carmen ( richards ) decides that she wants to join the troopers to fight the insects who are throwing asteroids at earth .  johnny then signs up as a trooper also , after an overacted argument with his parents .  but there is another girl , dizzy ( meyer ) , who likes johnny and then there is another boy who likes carmen , which results in a love quadrangle , which isn't better , because it means augmented worse-than-stereotyped soap opera , increased bitchiness , and more bad beverly hills + melrose .  and the result of this love quadrangle at the end is also rather stupid .  anyway , getting back to the thing you might call plot , johnny is too stupid to be a pilot and has to join the infantry , while his girl and the other dude are in the same league .  dizzy comes chasing johnny and joins the infantry also .  they then start training , which contains what roger ebert calls ips ( idiot plot syndrome , moments when only an idiot would have made such obvious mistakes ) , then real combat .  and guess what ?  that's about as complex as it gets .  oh , and one of their friends , carl ( neil patrick harris a . k . a . doogie howser m . d . ) , becomes involved in war intelligence , and his abilities at the end are really corny and make me want to spray insecticide on someone for it .  he's my fifth nom for a razzie .  the troopers fight , fall in love , die , kill , and try to act .  naturally , they win , or sort of half-win .  of course , in between ( and at the end ) there are soldiers chatting and smiling while carrying grievous wounds caused by bug legs .  the bugs also suffer from ips : why would you release hold of your captive before killing it ?  isn't it also amazing that earthlings haven't invented better hand-held weapons by then ?  the only question that remains is why i gave it one star instead of zero .  well , maybe a-quarter ( of a star ) for the originality of the co-sex shower scene and the ( very ) brief moments of suspense , another quarter for copying `zulu' and letting the good guys ( the bugs ) win , and half a star for the sucking-out of the brain of one of those people who call themselves actors ( but there should have been more , the troopers deserved to die ) .  
 " book " should have remained in shadows  book of shadows : blair witch 2  a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman  certain things in our lives are inevitable .  death , sorrow , love , heartbreak , pain , joy .  we expect these events .  we know they're going to happen and some , we even look forward to .  it's part of the human condition .  we have also become accustomed to inevitable occurrences in our society .  as we near the fall election , several of them are hitting us in the face .  politicians exaggerate their own importance .  our side is always right ; theirs is always wrong .  in the end , voters are usually forced to choose the lesser of two whocares .  in hollywood the one indisputable inevitable is that if a film makes big money , there will be a sequel .  even if the original story doesn't merit one .  even if the first film is complete in itself .  even if success is a fluke .   " the blair witch project " was made with a budget of $1 . 75 and exploded on the screen , raking in huge profits .  the concept was brilliant .  the filmmakers created a remarkable buzz that the story might be real .  the film itself was even more convincing .  the movie _must_ be authentic .  why else would such amateurish footage be on the big screen ?  the first film caught lightning in a bottle .  the sequel proves you can't pour that old lightning into a new bottle .  you have to give this effort some credit .  it would have been easy to have made the same movie again with a new group of kids .  it would have been easy , but of course , it wouldn't have worked .  instead " book of shadows " acknowledges the first film as a movie and concentrates on the hysteria following its release .  it's a great scheme and possibly the only entertaining way to do a sequel .  unfortunately it doesn't work either .  five kids spend the night in the woods at the scene of the first film .  weird stuff happens and they retreat to an old factory where one of them lives .  even weirder stuff happens .  some people die , there's blood and knives and none of the characters have a lick of common sense .  while supposedly doing serious research , the group sets up a circle of surveillance cameras in the ruins of the old house in the woods and vows to stay alert all night awaiting a visitation .  then they proceed to get totally trashed on drugs and alcohol and party down with very loud , very obnoxious heavy metal music .  it's a bad plan .  the cast shows some early promise .  a couple is doing research on a " blair witch " book .  the tour guide is a former mental patient turned ebay aficionado .  a goth amazon princess adds a bit of comedic relief .  the obligatory hot babe is the 2000 spiritual cinematic descendent of the cute hippie chick , the cute rock and roll chick and the cute disco chick : the cute wiccan chick .  the first film's unaccomplished actors came across as real people in a real situation because hours and hours of video were shot during days in the woods .  this time , these unaccomplished actors just come across as unaccomplished actors .  there's not one character you care about when they start shouting for no reason .  although what passes for a plot starts out with a solid idea , it's ruined by poor execution .  the follow-up to one of the most successful horror films ever is nothing more than a bad slasher movie .  they're trapped in an old big weird house .  they stupidly separate into various rooms .  there are strange noises , they see scary apparitions and people disappear .  ever see this movie ?  seasoned documentary director joe berlinger should know better .  the film features mostly cheap tricks and unnecessary gore .  for a storyline filled with surprises , it's oddly predicable .   " the blair witch project " was a rare triumph of style over substance .   " the book of shadows " is a triumph of tedium over promise .  
ever feel you're spending your whole life on the net ( ouch ! ) , eating , breathing and excreting web sites ?  that your most meaningful relationships are being formed on the net ?  that you get your best sex on the net ?  if first-time director hal salwen could shoot an entire movie of characters typing at their computers , he would .  as it is , he settles for characters talking on the phone .  denise calls up is a movie for and about the electronic generation , where characters are too caught up with their work and insecurities prefer to live out their relationships and fantasies on the phone .  it's a satire - and a sometimes funny one - about how we let handphones , call-waiting and answering machines run our lives .  the problem : denise calls up is a movie about an idea .  a darn good one , but still an 80 minute-long idea .  and despite salwen's attempt at plots and sub-plots , despite some genuinely funny moments , you can predict the movie's outcome within the first fifteen minutes .  you get the drift after a series of shots of characters explaining over the phone why they all couldn't make it for a party - nobody is going to be meeting anybody in this film , they would rather be talking on the phone .  here's salwen's plot : while all the characters are in a dysfunctional , telefixated limbo , loud quirky stranger denise calls up martin to announce that she is pregnant with his child , courtesy of the sperm he donated to the local bank .  as martin progresses from slamming the phone on her to long phone conversations over the baby's name , his friends - and his friends' friends - get involved , courtesy of call-waiting and double-lines .  in the tigher and more tantalizing sub-plot , barbara and jerry are set up on a blind date that neither turns up for .  both profess to have too complicated schedules to ever meet , but they get it going over the phone .  with repeated phone sex comes a glitch ; what if the other person is simply faking it ?  denise calls up scores with some inspired moments .  mousy barbara metamorphoses into a vamp over her cordless , everyone shares the excitement of denise's delivery through a conference call to her handphone , and barbara's best friend gale is killed in a car accident while taling animatedly into another friend's answering machine .   ( as gale's overly-chatty aunt recounts , her cordless was knicked into her ear and lodged in her brain . )  but these moments are not enough to sustain the movie .  the pace sags , the dialogue drags and not much acting appears to be required of the telephone-touters .  and the ending is literally a non-event as expected , everyone is too chicken to turn up for the party frank throws in gale's memory despite promising over the phone that they will .  we get the point .  the movie appears to be intent on flogging its terribly-'90s statement until they have it coming out of your ears .  pun intended .  there's even a on the movie's web site where you can win cellular phones ( as if we haven't had enough of these things already ) .  watch the movie only if you find it philosophy compelling enough for a earful .  the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .  
 " some houses are born bad , " goes the haunting's tag line , to which i must add , " some movies , too . "  nothing short of hiring a new cast , a more literate screenwriter , and a new director could have saved this tragically misguided adaptation of jackson's meritorious novel .  the haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy , and its seemingly endless stream of digital trickery and spooky ooky sound effects don't frighten so much as numb the audience into submission-the film is like a rube goldberg contraption rigged to shout " boo . "  fragile nell ( taylor ) , bisexual theo ( zeta-jones ) , and smiley luke ( wilson ) are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly possessed hill house for an extended study on sleep disorders , hosted by professor marrow ( neeson ) .  marrow's secretly gathering data on their respective paranoid responses to his recount of hill house's bleak history .  he's not prepared for the very real apparitions that terrorize the crew , nell especially , who has some ancestral connection to the manor's previous inhabitants .  taylor is thoroughly insufferable in her first big-budget lead .  for starters , her consistently dour expression sucks the life out of even the early scenes , when we're introduced to the mansion and all its fun-house trappings .  her character is supposed to be depressed , having tended to an unloving mother for too many years , but taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame , alternately grouchy , mopey , wiggy and pathetic , and i kept wondering why the other characters didn't just ditch this bitch .  as for the obscenely photogenic zeta-jones , she breezes through her scenes with a wink and a smile and takes the scenery with her .  unfortunately , she's saddled with some of the most unlikely dialogue the screenplay has to offer .  theo's assessment of the house ?   " i love it !  sort of charles foster kane meets the munsters . "  who on earth would say that in place of " citizen kane meets the munsters " ?   ( furthermore , would you gladly spend a single night in a house befitting that description ? )  both actresses fare better than neeson , who looks embarrassed to be a part of this ensemble ( and for good reason ) , and his character is the most bland .  as luke puts it , dr . marrow pulls the old " academic bait and switch " on his subjects , but he breaks down and confesses to this the second he's accused .  later , he risks his life by climbing a crumbling stairwell to save nell ( it's amusing to hear neeson shout " nell " repeatedly , given his starring role in the 1994 jodie foster vehicle of the same name ) .  why was this nice , helpful , and redemptive researcher so absent of ethics at the start ?  the haunting was well designed by eugenio zanetti .  his sets are obsessively detailed , and even before the cgi kicks in , they seem alive , never quite still .  i do have one beef with this aspect of the production : the real life mansion used in exterior shots , nottinghamshire's harlaxton manor , is so vast that one has trouble believing that nell and company , no matter how much running away they do from ghosts and goblins , always finish up in locations that were established in act one , as if all the action has been confined to one wing of hill house .  eighty million dollars was spent on the haunting , and despite a powerhouse box office debut , i doubt it will recoup its costs ( including marketing ) domestically .  thank jan de bont for that : proving for the third time that speed was a fluke , in that it was actually enjoyable , de bont has served up another ride , sans thrill .  his images , well-lit though they are , have an unmistakable been there-done that quality ; in fact , whole sequences , not to mention the cloaked , airy ghoul who owns the climax , feel lifted from a much smarter and infinitely more enjoyable spectacle from three summers back , peter jackson's the frighteners .  i don't mean to suggest de bont is a plagiarist , i mean to suggest that he's a hack , having found no new ways to give us chills .  
these days , people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run .  1970s nostalgia is already wearing off , and now , people are becoming more and more interested in 1980s .  few years in the future , early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia .  however , i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period .  one of the reason would surely be films like national lampoon's loaded weapon 1 , that , in many ways , symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry - lack of originality and ideas .  being made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series , this film pairs two l . a . policemen - jack colt ( emilio estevez ) , burn-out alcoholic cop on the edge , and wes luger ( samuel l . jackson ) , by-the-book policeman , days away from retirement .  two of them , following the murder of luger's ex- partner , must confront evil general mortars ( william shatner ) , crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies .  the authors of this films ( whose director , gene quintano , worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy ) lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects , and that reflects in the lack plot , characters , and , even original lines .  the plot , or what goes for the plot in this movie , is nothing more than a series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years ( apart from lethal weapon series , this film " borrows " its female lead from basic instinct ) .  the best gags , are , same as with many other similar movies , shown in the trailers .  the rest simply doesn't work .  only those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh .  others would probably wince at the lameness of humour .  some would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a while .  but , at the end , spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of a movie is simply not worth the effort .  the film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of a series that already had strong comic overtones .  the authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using the loaded weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequel .  
wow , a film without any redeeming qualities whatsoever .  i'm amazed that someone thought this was a story that must be told on screen .  many blacks in hollywood complain that they are not nominated for awards based on their race .  i think first they need to concentrate their energy on themselves , and stop making movies which makes them look like nothing more than sex-crazed buffoons .  even i'm offended by it .  bill bellamy is a " player " which means he sleeps with a lot of women and lies to them .  what a pleasant main character .  one day , his friends decide that they want to find out how to be a player .  why they decide this " one day " i have no idea .  how many years have they been friends and why all of a sudden would they want to learn ?  anyway , bellamy agrees to teach , and his wonderful lesson to his friends consists of letting them ride in his car while he rides from house to house having sex with women .  this is the bulk of the film folks , guys riding from house to house , one keeps getting out to have sex , while the others sit in the car .  since russell simmons is producer , and since the official title of the film is " def jam's how to be a player " , i was ready to be jumping up and down and stomping my feet and beating the person next to me because of the comedy .  amazingly , aside from gilbert gottfried's 90 seconds of screen time , there was no comedy in the film for me to express myself in such a manner .  instead of jokes , there's just an endless stream of profanity and naked breasts ( and naked breasts aren't so bad , but naked breasts alone don't make a good movie ) .  be sure to bring along your ebonics to english dictionary as well .  gilbert gottfried's character serves as one in his very brief appearance , asking for explanations as to what is being said .  they should have brought him along for the entire film .

some movies ask you to leave your brain at the door , some movies ask you to believe in the impossible to really have a good time .  playing god asks just one simple , eensy , teensy thing so it can fully entertain you , it's accomplished in just four easy to follow steps : crack open your skull , scoop out your brain , squish it under your foot several times and reverse steps two and one .  congratulations , you now have all the necessary requirements to fully enjoy a whole lot of nothing .  some movies fail at the box office but you manage to see why the producers thought it could have been a good movie , others are simply good ideas that are badly executed .  then there's playing god , which enters the esteemed category of movies which seem to have grown from the union of a drunk director , actors satisfied in the knowledge that this horrible flick will have no lasting impact on their careers and a bunch of rip-offs ( or homages as they like to call it ) from other , better movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet .  harsh ? maybe .  justified ?  hell yes !  this is a movie that is not just satisfied in ripping off other movies but feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes .  for example , a gunman bursts into a garden with the two guns in his hands firing away .  this does look moderately kool , but the camera lingers on the actor for so long you can almost hear the director yelling : " oooh , look look !  john woo !  two guns blazing !  slooooow motion ! "  and if that wasn't enough , you can also hear the script grunting under the effort it must take to try and make every single line of dialogue sound like something deep and meaningful like in a tarantino movie .  poor timothy hutton gets to deliver most of the corny lines , you have to admire the effort he puts into it , this guy deserves better .  unlike most movies this one does not suffer from " stupid bad guy " syndrome , just to make things a little different this time we get stupid heroes .  example : duchovny manages to distract a bad guy by making him go into the bathroom to get some bandages .  now the bad guy is , like , stoned , man , so he leaves his shotgun next to our hero .   ( term used as loosely as possible )  survival instincts and a good dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun , which our hero does , but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds .  even when he does grab it he seems unsure how to hold it , going so far as to actually wonder if he should place a finger near the trigger .  mind you , i've never fired a shotgun in my life but believe you me that the bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs , be he stoned or not .  some will argue that our hero does not have a killer instinct , the hell with that !  two fbi guys have just been shot in front me , along with one bad guy and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second .  solution ?  boom !  i'll take the time to feel sorry about it later thank you very much .  another prime example of the idiot hero syndrome :  our boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to her .  he knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of a building and that he might be running into a room full of people with itchy trigger fingers .  he still has his shotgun , bring it along you say ?  no thanks , i'll just ditch it in the back of my car .  and the real kicker is this : when he reaches the room and people start shooting at him he has the nerve to look surprised !  while we are on the subject of getting shot , why in hades were those fbi guys sitting with their backs to the door ?  i've got no formal training but even i know you never sit with your back to the door .  ask mr . wild bill , the first and only time he did not sit with his back to a wall cost him his life .  this is the major problem with this movie , any mook could have thought of a hundred ways to make it better .  is it so much to ask that hollywood actually put a little common sense into their characters ?  for instance :  our heroes hide at duchovny's summer home , now the bad guys could come knocking at any moment .  ok , this time our hero does get himself a gun and has it at his side most of the time .  but see , our hero is a drug addict and guess what ?  he chooses now to go clean and suffer through dt .  oh sure , he'll be really impressive when the bad guys come calling .  going clean is really honorable of him , but i would have waited until i did not need to be conscious or being able to fire a gun .  for an enjoyable performance by timothy hutton , plot holes the size of godzilla , getting our intelligence insulted and several " oh come on ! "  moments .  
i didn't come into city of angels expecting greatness .  i've never seen wim wenders' wings of desire , the classic movie upon which city is loosely based .  then again , i have seen enough stories which are based upon a similar plot device , with the little mermaid ( both the disney version and the original folktale ) being among them , that i had some high expectations about the possible power such a story of impossible love can hold .  unfortunately , city of angels ended up fulfilling few of them .  the plot , for those that couldn't tell from the previews , revolves around the angel seth , played with an almost creepy intensity by nicolas cage , who , in the midst of his angelic duties , falls in love with a heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan in her most endearing performance since when harry met sally ) .  of course , his being an angel prevents him from doing much about his love except appearing at random times to talk to her , watch her buy groceries , only to disappear in the blink of an eye .  their love must remain unrequited unless seth decides to make the ultimate sacrifice and become human .  using this framework as a jumping-off point , the movie attempts to veer through some heavy philosophical ruminations on the nature of desire , the joys of being human , and the definition of perfection .  the first half of the movie succeeds on most points .  cage excellently plays the eminently difficult role of an angel who doesn't know feelings so can't really express , preventing the character of seth from getting boring despite his limited repertoire of intent looks and hang-dog expressions .  unfortunately , cage takes the intensity too far sometimes , and then seth comes across as more creepy than sensitive .  as maggie , ryan manages to be convincing as a heart surgeon who has trouble coming to terms with her having lost a patient on the operating table despite having done everything right .  her beauty , unlike her unbearable cuteness in french kiss , is mature , intelligent , and winning .  likewise , some interesting ideas float around at the beginning of the film .  when the camera pans through traffic jams and libraries and we get to hear the thoughts of the random people who flash across the screen , the audience experiences a little of what it must be like to be an angel .  the beautiful camera work , shooting down onto the hectic world of los angeles from the improbable perches of the angels , also gives us a sense of the unique wonder angels feel .  the film begins to lose its way , though , when the focus tightens more and more on seth and maggie .  the grand , angelic perspective gets lost , except for some idly tossed lines about the incredible beauty of the world through an angel's eyes .  the movie devolves into an examination of how seth can't feel the world or , more importantly , he can't feel maggie : he can't smell her hair , feel her touch , or taste the pears she eats .  this change in focus attempts to capture the audience in seth's intense longing , but in doing so , the conflict disappears .  if he wants maggie so badly , then why doesn't her just make the leap and become human ?  after all , what's so great about being an angel ?  sure , you get to sit on marlboro signs , but what's that compared to getting to be with meg ryan ?  and from there , once the yearning has been established and the romantic denouement must occur , it's all downhill .  the philosophy becomes heavy-handed , the dialogue pedestrian when it tries to be deep , and the plot twists simply attempt to yank a few more tears into the audience's hankie .  it's the last thirty minutes of the movie , then , that wrecks the film .  i feel like the writer , by pulling out all the melodramatic stops , has robbed me of what could have been a genuinely powerful movie experience on both the romantic and the philosophical level .  i came out feeling robbed , seeing so much possibility in a film becoming nothing .  i could go on longer , but i don't want to " ruin " the end by revealing any of the cheap plot devices the film relies on .  city of angels , then , is a paradox .  it's a well-acted ( particularly look for dennis franz cutting against type-casting as a happy-go-lucky fallen angel ) , well-filmed , and based on a wonderful idea .  all these possibilities , though , are what make the film so unredeemable when the closing credits come up .  
an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis' 1981 feature , an american werewolf in london .  where the original had comedy , the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in tv sit-coms .  where the first installment had chills , this one has sequences that are inappropriately , unintentionally funny .  in short , while an american werewolf in london has become something of a minor classic in its genre , the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax ( it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity ) .  the film opens with a trio of daredevil americans -- andy ( tom everett scott ) , brad ( vince vieluf ) , and chris ( phil buckman ) -- sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine and do a little bungee jumping .  soon they have company in the person of serafine ( julie delpy ) , who has decided to end it all .  she jumps , but andy , with a bungee cord attached , goes after her , and manages to save her ( at the price of a major headache ) .  serafine disappears , but a smitten andy seeks her out .  however , once he learns his would-be girlfriend's dark secret , he wishes he hadn't .  she's a werewolf , cursed to change into a hideous beast when the moon is full , and , to make matters worse , he has suffered a nasty bite himself .  actress julie delpy is far too good for this movie .  she imbues serafine with spirit , spunk , and humanity , which gives us an emotional stake in the character's fate .  this isn't necessarily a good thing , since it prevents us from relaxing and enjoying an american werewolf in paris as a completely mindless , campy entertainment experience .  delpy's injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with a better script and a better cast surrounding her .  delpy's previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski's white and richard linklater's before sunrise .  she was radiant , charismatic , and effective in both .  given the nature and level of the material she has to work with here , she gets as close as possible to those adjectives .  it could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris , but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one a miss .  and if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff , check out either killing zoe or the passion of beatrice -- those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts .  the rest of the cast acts at a level considerably below that of delpy -- which is to say , they give performances appropriate for the screenplay .  tom everett scott ( that thing you do ) plays the lead like he's in a made-for-tv movie .  it would be kind to call him bland .  actors vince vieluf and phil buckman , as andy's friends , are no more impressive .  julie bowen ( happy gilmore ) is suitably fetching as werewolf meat .  and respected french actor thierry lhermitte has a brief turn as another monster meal .  on the technical side , it's all bad news .  the computer-generated werewolves look painfully unreal .  the creatures would probably have been more believable had they been men in wolf suits .  repeated use is made of the " werewolf cam " , an infrared wolf's point-of-view approach that's interesting the first couple of times it's employed , then becomes tedious .  and the soundtrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes that clash violently with the on-screen action they're matched to .  director anthony waller , who displayed a confident , edgy style in mute witness , stumbles with this material , never being able to make the comedy and horror elements gel .  as a result , we get the worst werewolf sequel since the howling ii : your sister is a werewolf .   ( i will give waller credit for killing off a dog , though -- something that's rarely seen in movies these days . ) an american werewolf in paris is marginally entertaining in a " bad movie " sort of way , but that's a dubious distinction .  ultimately , it's an unfortunate effort , for , while it isn't unbearable to sit through , it isn't a howl , either .  
i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night , but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies .  luckily , my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta !  i knew it was going to be a bad print with only half-faces and poor sound quality , but i couldn't help myself . . .  i got it .  well , after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i didn't dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie .  this movie really sucks .  it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy ! !  for example , how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days ?  jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail .  the songs are bad , the acting is bad ( especially deepti bhatnagar's ) , and the direction is the worst of all .  the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up .  i didn't even finish the movie . . .  i couldn't take it anymore .  note : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ) , i guess you'd like this movie .  it's practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff .  aditya panscholi is the sidekick again .   ( i was going to give it a zero , but i personally like jackie shroff , so i loosened up a little .  he looked fresh , wore good clothes ( as always ) , and his performance , even though it wasn't his best , was the only saving grace of the movie )  
so much for sweet returns .  after smart horror films were starting to be made again after the exploitative 80's slasher movies , starting with 1996's " scream , " and followed by " scream 2 , " " urban legend , " and the original , " i know what you did last summer , " a film like , " i still know what you did last summer , " was bound to be made sooner or late .  it is a perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out , and that is because they reached for the lowest-common-denominator in filmmaking , favoring non-stop deaths and gore for suspense , and trading in fleshed out , likable characters for one-dimensional nitwits .  it has been exactly one year since julie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) suffered through the ordeal of being terrorized by ben willis , a psychopathic fisherman whom her friends and she accidentally hit in the middle of the road , and then , thinking he was dead , dumped him into the ocean .  since then , julie has relocated to boston university , and although often paranoid and haunted by bad dreams , she has been able to put her life back together .  when julie's friend , karla ( brandy ) , is called up by a radio station and answers correctly what the capital of brazil is , she wins a vacation to the bahamas for four people , which also includes karla's horny boyfriend , tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , and will ( matthew settle ) , who karla sets julie up with after her own boyfriend , ray ( freddie prinze jr . , also returning from the original ) , doesn't show up .  when they reach the secluded island , they discover it is the last day of the open season , and will be stranded there for the 4th of july weekend with a few employees to fend off a violent storm headed for them .  of course , julie , her friends , and the workers aren't the only ones there , as the murderous ben willis , dressed in fisherman garb , returns to seek revenge on julie once and for all .  it is a sad state of affairs when a movie like , " i still know what you did last summer , " is made .  i am a very big fan of horror movies , and so it is especially disheartening to find out that this sequel to " ikwydls , " which i am a fan of , is almost an exact replica of a " friday the 13th " movie .  while the original focused more on the story and characters , as well as genuinely suspenseful moments , thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson ( who didn't return to write the sequel , and it shows ) , " i still know . . . "  has no story to speak of , and is so vacuous of ideas , that the filmmakers , were forced to have a murder occur every five minutes just to keep the audience interested .  also gone are any signs of character development , and since every single character died before i got to know them , all i was left with was to stare at the screen , indifferent to what was going on .  while i cared about the fates of the characters in the original , it made no difference to me in this sequel who lived and died .  they were all paper-thin and pointless , except to become victims to the lethal hook of the fisherman .  another element that made the original so memorable were some superbly crafted set-pieces , like the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar , but there are none to speak of in this sequel ( although they do come close at one moment with brandy ) .  since so many people were killed every couple minutes , the suspense and scares evaporated faster than salt in water .  also of note is the mystery of the second killer , and accomplice to ben , but it is obvious from the first frame who it is , and so i couldn't even have fun at that , like i did in the " scream " movies and , " urban legend . "  it figures that just as slasher films were starting to get some recognition again , a film would come along and ruin it for everyone else .  maybe the people who made , " i still know what you did last summer , " should have realized that in order to make a good movie , you must have a screenplay---or at least one that isn't such a black hole for thoughts and ideas .  the ending of the film inevitably leaves the door wide open for a third part , but judging from this amazingly lackluster first sequel , everyone involved should have quit while they were still ahead .  
american pie 2 is filled with laughs .  but they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for a locker room than a movie theater .  i'm no prude and i admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the 1999 hit comedy .  but the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment , not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself .  what separates american pie 2 from its predecessor is heart .  of the original , i noted it was " a warm , pleasant outing about the travails of growing up . "  well , the quartet of chums - jim ( jason biggs ) , oz ( chris klein ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) - have grown up .  at least they are a year older , but don't seem any wiser .  fresh from their first year of college the quartet , along with the obnoxious stifler ( seann william scott ) , rent a summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score .  as usual nothing goes right until the last reel .  but what we are left with is five guys spending nearly two hours drooling over various young women .  and american pie 2 is rather degrading to women .  for the most part , they are not shown as individuals .  they are nothing more than potential recipients of over-active , raging hormones .  it is telling that the most normal couple , oz and heather ( mena suvari ) spend the bulk of the film trying to have phone sex - she's overseas on an exchange student program .  despite having been to college , jim is still klutzy and awkward , unsure of himself around the opposite sex .  most of the pratfalls and humiliations are heaped upon him , including a painful episode involving an instant glue-like substance .  also uncomfortable to watch is a sequence involving three of the lads with two young women roommates , whom the boys suspect of being lesbians .  it is offensive and plays upon outdated , adolescent stereotypes to generate laughs .  the first film , despite some raunchy moments , had an innocent charm to it .  the sequel is more cynical .  it knows what its predominantly male audience members want and unabashedly gives it to them : the many mentions of finch's encounter with stifler's mom becomes a tiresome running gag throughout as does eugene levy's return as jim's well-meaning , trying-to-be-hip dad .  the only performer who is actually given some new , fresh material is alyson hannigan as michelle , the band geek from the original .  in the sequel , she imbues her character with vulnerability , wisdom and maturity .  american pie 2 is a pre-sold commodity that will earn several million at the box office .  it is a shame , though , that in its rush to rake in some bucks screenwriter adam herz , who also penned the original , could not have set his sights higher .  american pie 2 is funny , but it's still a comedown as well as a letdown .  
this is crap , but , honestly , what older american audience is going to be able to resist seeing jack lemmon and james garner as bicker- ing ex-presidents ?  especially when their supporting players in- clude dan aykroyd as the current commander in chief , lauren bacall as a former first lady , and john heard as the dan quayle-ish vice president .  yup , you're talkin' pre-sold property here and , for warner brothers , the perfect fit into their now-ritual grumpy old men holiday slot .  for the non-discriminating viewer , my fellow americans is fine .  the raw star power alone will have audiences applauding this atrocious political- thriller road-comedy .   ( they did in mine , heaven help us . )  for the rest of us , the movie is immediately tiresome .  the tone is terrible and the banter is worse .  forget wit-- lemmon and garner merely exchange profanities through most of the movie .   ( has anyone counted the number of first penis references ? )  sure , some of the bits are absurdly funny , including a men's room macarena joke , the appearance of an elvis impersonator on a trainload of tarheels , and an all dorothy marching band performing " over the rainbow " at a gay men's march .  the get there from here , though , you have to submit to one of the most offensively overbearing musical scores of all time .  judas priest , is there a single moment of silence in this film ?  even the dialogue gets drowned out .  what a waste .  
the kids in the hall are an acquired taste .  it took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer .  maybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies , they would grow into the big screen .  my recommendation is that , unless you are a big fan of the kids , skip the film .  as it is , their first--and most likely only--attempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv .  a big-budget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show .  the kids go through the motions , but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so .  and this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics .  brain candy is a bunch of skits tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression .  in typical sketch-comedy tradition , each actor plays several roles .  doctor cooper ( kevin mcdonald ) and his team create the drug .  then , under pressure from don roritor ( mark mckinney ) , founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals , dr . cooper releases the drug into the marketplace .  the ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film .  at about 90 minutes , brain candy still seems long .  the best thing about sketch comedy--and the kids are no exception--is the ability to quickly deliver the laughs , then go on to another quick skit .  but with the additional set-up necessary in telling a longer , coherent story , the laughs just dont come fast enough .  strangely , the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv .  the movie makes several attempts at risqueness--mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons characters--but they seem almost forced ; as if they have to live up to a pg rating .  one of the best bits , though , does make use of thompsons naked buttocks ; we see him charging into battle--going to have sex with some guys taking a shower .  in the classic of this genre , monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail .  the kids , unfortunately , are not up to the task .  there are some amusing moments , to be sure , but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one .  
brian de palma's snake eyes stars nicolas cage's evil twin , who confusingly uses the same stage name as his talented brother .  like a foreign tourist who screams his lines in english to ensure that he will be understood , cage yells with the ferocity of a man with a bad case of caffeine overload .  de palma , whose last great film , the untouchables , was crafted over a decade ago seems to have lost his magic .  in snake eyes , he manages to elicit some of the worst performances possible out of a skilled cast .  only gary sinise rises slightly above the hackneyed material .  the rest of the actors become caricatures in this by-the-numbers thriller .  ryuichi sakamoto's atmospheric and melodramatic music dominates almost every scene .  heavy on the long violin notes , its rhythm is punctuated by thunder .   ( the script by de palma and lost world's david koepp sets the action during a hurricane in an attempt to pump up the adrenaline level and the noise .  only the latter is achieved . )  cage plays rick santoro , a corrupt atlantic city cop who shakes down criminals to get betting money .  the movie takes place over a single evening when a world championship fight is being held .  with a flashy , bad wardrobe and a gold cell phone , rick is an obnoxious cop who doesn't know when to shut up .  spouting cliched and ridiculous dialog , he screams such lines as , " i was made for the sewer , baby ! "  actually the line is more apropos for the movie as a whole .  sinise plays kevin dunne , a naval officer who is in charge of the security for the secretary of the navy , who has come to watch the fight .  but most people in the film are not who they seem to be , and the thin script makes all of them easy to guess .  the plot , which is told in endless flashbacks , concerns the assassination of the secretary through a scheme set up by some malevolent businessmen ? that adjective is , of course , redundant in hollywood thrillers .  the flashbacks become repetitious with the same scene shown again and again , sometimes from a different perspective and sometimes not .  although a brian de palma film requires a certain amount of gratuitous violence , this one is remarkably tame for the man who became famous when he made carrie .  the movie's outline has some promise , but the movie itself is leaden .  the film takes itself all too seriously .  at best , it is a 1940s-style b movie .  a little humor would have helped the script some , but a complete rewrite would have been better .  and , although i hate to say it , a different director would have been the biggest improvement .  snake eyes runs 1 : 39 .  it is rated r for violence and would be acceptable for teenagers .  
phaedra cinema , the distributor of such never-heard-of classics as " soft toilet seats , " " trailer : the movie , " and " the one armed boxer vs . the flying guillotine , " has sneaked its latest release , " the sculptress , " into a few theaters this weekend hoping to cash in on a handful of halloween holidaygoers looking for a right good scare .   " the sculptress " is a scary proposition all right , but not in the way its producers intended .  from the outset it's easy to see why some of the larger , more reputable chains aren't carrying it : the film looks like a straight-to-video release from the early '80s that's been dusted off ( not very carefully ) and re-issued in theatrical format .  that staple of schlocky z-movies jeff fahey ( " the lawnmower man " ) plays a washed-up shakespearean actor lacking in some basic people skills .  when he's not reliving his glory days in his ramshackle nob hill apartment , screaming scotch-induced " hamlet " soliloquies well into the night , he's out and about on the streets of san francisco stalking loose women .  fahey's dobie sizes up his victims ( actually just one , a peep show performer name of sylvie ) dressed like one of the guys from kraftwerk , and approaches them in the ridiculous attire of a bavarian count replete with a cane , dark glasses , and a false beard ( just in time for halloween ! ) .   " do you have a castle ? "  sylvie asks dobie seductively when he flashes the bulging contents of his wallet outside a coffee shop .   " jah .  with ze many turrets " is dobie's perplexing reply .  the real " star " of the film ( and i use that term extremely loosely ) is katie wright , who plays the sculptress of the title .  sarah is new in town , studying at the prestigious sf art institute under the mentorship of a " genius " frenchman , played by the beret-wearing patrick bauchau .  that's convenient , because sarah would one day like to live and work in paris ( you won't believe the film's final shot , with its cheesy eiffel tower backdrop and " rosemary's baby " -inspired imagery ) .  bauchau's character criticizes sarah's work publicly ( her clay busts keep turning into gargoyles--perhaps she's possessed . . .  by an incubus ! ! ? ) but he still manages to talk her into dinner .  whereas wright does a decent english accent , her talents pretty much end there .  on the other side of the wall , dobie's troubled past is succinctly summarized in a scene in which he thumbs through an old scrapbook of newspaper clippings with headings like " actor delivers a stunning macbeth , " actor courted by hollywood studio , " " actor renounces hollywood for priesthood , " and " prostitute fingers priest in sex scandal . "  the film's plot could have been just as easily condensed .   " artist moves in next door to shakespearean psychopath . "   " yawns ensue . "  so dobie rants and raves and sarah chips away at large blocks of granite till way past their bedtimes .  late in the film , their paths finally cross with mind-numbing results .  nobody else in the apartment complex appears to mind all the racket , but one old dear does go ballistic when sarah's bathtub overflows .  no , we don't see wright in the tub ( or fahey for that matter ) , and the gore quotient is virtually nil , so for a horror film " the sculptress " is surprisingly lacking .  the only thing worth looking at is san francisco , and writer/director ian merrick manages to make even it look dreary , windswept , and deserted .   " the sculptress " isn't even bad enough to be fun .  luckily , a limited release has made it easy to avoid .  
 " tina ! ! ! fetch me the axe ! ! ! "  a favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981 , paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands .  it wasn't just the film's disappointing box office performance .  indeed , in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two , three , even six times .  no , the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year .  in a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events , some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming : " mommie dearest : the biggest mommie of them all ! " .  executives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn , but it was all too late .  mommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history .  unfortunately , faye dunaway's energetic , at times ridiculously over-the-top performance is about the film's only redeeming feature .  based on daughter christina crawford's trashy biography , mommie dearest chronicles a series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother .  if you believe this movie , it was a life was racked by obsession , lonliness , child abuse and rampant egomania .  the film begins with crawford adopting two children , and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grown-up daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mother's will .  joan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves , you see .  but that's about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the film's end .  the script - laboured over by four writers , a bad sign in itself - is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum .  frank perry's direction is no more than competent , and dunaway's bitchy lines aside , the dialogue is flat and uninvolving .  in fairness , the film's second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics and does develop a degree empathy for its characters .  when the adult christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling , joan visits and keeps in touch , not helping her financially but encouraging christina's own acting and career ambitions .  crawford does seem to care about her daughter , but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain .  you also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers .  ah , but there is dunaway's performance .  and what a delicious piece of campery it often is .  having just been sacked by her studio after a run of box office duds , crawford storms home late at night and proceeds to go ballistic in the garden .  she has the maid drag the kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess she's making .  spotting a young tree she doesn't like the look of , she turns to the trembling christina and utters the immortal line " tina ! !  fetch me the axe ! ! "  with which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember the poor sapling .  in the film's most outrageous scene , joan realises that some of her daughter's clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers .  oh dear !  sounds like the perfect excuse for another temper tantrum , doesn't it ?  this time she gives her daughter a horrible beating while delivering another classic outburst : " no . . . wire . . . hangers . . . . ever ! ! ! ! " .  and later , when the board of her late husband's company pepsi cola tries to divest her of her directorship , she displays a superb grasp of business etiquette by jumping to her feet and roaring : " don't fuck with me , fellas ! ! " .  oh joy !  something of a camp classic , then , but if that's not you're cup of tea then mommie dearest doesn't have too much to recommend it .  better you see the real crawford in the women ( 1939 ) , mildred pierce ( 1945 ) or whatever happened to baby jane ( 1962 ) .  great films distinguished by great performances , and a far more eloquent testament to this great woman than frank perry's shrieking piece of tabloid froth .  
there's only one presidential election every four years , but it seems like every few months we get another presidential conspiracy movie painted as _the_ thriller of the year .  in 1997 , we've had absolute power , air force one , shadow conspiracy and murder at 1600 .  this one is about as lame duck as old gerald ford , trying to bring us a complex plot of cover-up and intrigue but copping out over and over again with rehashes of action flick standbys .  here's what happens this time .  it's night at the white house .  a secretary is having sex with some unidentified guy with a cute butt .  the next day she's dead and hotshot detective wesley snipes is called in .  how do we know he's a hotshot ?  we've seen the traditional action flick opener -- the clever hostage negotiation scene .  it's not so clever this time , consisting of snipes disarming a suicidal ex-government employee holding a gun to his head in the middle of the street .  snipes is off to the white house , where he finds the secret service head ( the shiny bald head of daniel benzali ) won't cooperate with him at all .  in fact , if not for the intervention of national security adviser alan alda , snipes wouldn't have been allowed in the white house at all .  alda helps snipes out further , assigning a sexy secret service agent ( diane lane ) to act as his liaison . . .  a very dangerous liaison .  well , not really , i just wanted to say that .  almost immediately , a suspect is found , an eccentric night janitor seen flirting with the deceased on one of the security videos .  snipes doesn't buy it , and launches into an independent investigation of his own , one that reveals planted evidence and romantic involvement by the president's son .  snipes' partner , an always- wisecracking dennis miller , calls him up every once in awhile with more news and lane , who at first doesn't believe snipes , eventually and predictably comes around , and risks her ass to break into social security storage and break out some classified information .  for the first hour or so , murder at 1600 looks like it could be going somewhere interesting .  sure , we have to sit through the lame opening sequence and plenty more lame scenes after that , but the whole murder in the white house thing makes for an interesting premise that is never quite delivered upon .  snipes and lane don't make for a bad action team , but with nothing to work with , they're just cogs in the bad movie machine .  dennis miller might as well not even be in the movie ; they waste his talents more in murder at 1600 than they did in bordello of blood , and that's saying a lot .  when you get to the last half-hour , the movie has descended metaphorically and literally into a wet sewer , busting out the old break-into-the-building underground climax .  and when they finally reveal who killed the woman and why , you'll wish you never sat through this movie at all .  the " 1600 " in the movie's title doesn't represent an address , it represents the number of satisfied customers worldwide .  serving the world for nearly 1/25th of a century !  
 " quest for camelot " is warner bros . ' first feature-length , fully-animated attempt to steal clout from disney's cartoon empire , but the mouse has no reason to be worried .  the only other recent challenger to their throne was last fall's promising , if flawed , 20th century fox production " anastasia , " but disney's " hercules , " with its lively cast and colorful palate , had her beat hands-down when it came time to crown 1997's best piece of animation .  this year , it's no contest , as " quest for camelot " is pretty much dead on arrival .  even the magic kingdom at its most mediocre -- that'd be " pocahontas " for those of you keeping score -- isn't nearly as dull as this .  the story revolves around the adventures of free-spirited kayley ( voiced by jessalyn gilsig ) , the early-teen daughter of a belated knight from king arthur's round table .  kayley's only dream is to follow in her father's footsteps , and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber ( gary oldman ) , an ex-round table member-gone-bad , steals arthur's magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in a dangerous , booby-trapped forest .  with the help of hunky , blind timberland-dweller garrett ( carey elwes ) and a two-headed dragon ( eric idle and don rickles ) that's always arguing with itself , kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as a fighter on arthur's side .   " quest for camelot " is missing pure showmanship , an essential element if it's ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney .  there's nothing here that differentiates " quest " from something you'd see on any given saturday morning cartoon -- subpar animation , instantly forgettable songs , poorly-integrated computerized footage .   ( compare kayley and garrett's run-in with the angry ogre to herc's battle with the hydra .  i rest my case . )  even the characters stink -- none of them are remotely interesting , so much that the film becomes a race to see which one can out-bland the others .  in the end , it's a tie -- they all win .  that dragon's comedy shtick is awfully cloying , but at least it shows signs of a pulse .  at least fans of the early-'90s tgif television line-up will be thrilled to find jaleel " urkel " white and bronson " balki " pinchot sharing the same footage .  a few scenes are nicely realized ( though i'm at a loss to recall enough to be specific ) , and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic ( though most are paired up with singers who don't sound a thing like them for their big musical moments -- jane seymour and celine dion ? ? ? ) .  but one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good .  aside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults , " quest for camelot " 's most grievous error is its complete lack of personality .  and personality , we learn from this mess , goes a very long way .  
the previews for the movie are pretty good .  they show a little plot , all the characters , and the emotional highlights , all spliced together to give a general impression of the script .  unfortunately , the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes .  the residents of mystery love hockey .  mystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football .  the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a player who's guilty of shooting another man ( yes , that's one of the movie's jokes . )  every saturday , the best players pair off for a game , and the whole town comes to watch .  the town's prodigal son charlie ( hank azaria ) wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated .  mystery's national fame has the town abuzz .  a week later , charlie actually shows up in person , and he brings with him an offer from the nhl .  the new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals .  the mysterians see this as both good and bad .  on the one hand , they'd love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition .  on the other hand , they don't want to turn up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes .  the movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the proposition .  biebe ( russell crowe ) has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys , including his new replacement .  he's already resentful , and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife .  crowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film , so he's just kind of stuck with constantly brooding .  charlie , meanwhile , is resentful of having born in a town where hockey is the only measure of a man's worth .  his " gift " of the feature story , and of the new york rangers , was his way of compensating for not being a better skater .  he hoped it would earn him some respect and merit , but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him .  burt reynolds could have been interesting as walter , the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans .  walter actually has some experience with collegiate hockey , but he actively tries to put it behind him .  he wants his son to take the game more seriously , but he wants his community to just get over it .  reynolds could have been good , but sloppy writing and/or editing keep walter in the corner , and so reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together .  one character actually was interesting .  biebe's wife ( mary mccormack ) , like the judge , understood that there was more to life than hockey .  but unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community .  she chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open .  her unique insight is verbalized once , and it lasts only a scene before it is gone , but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom .  mysterty , alaska follows a handful of other characters , but none are well developed or worth mentioning .  the biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to the story , no underlying thing that the movie is really about .  instead , roach and screenwriters david e . kelley and sean o'byrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy .  they try to make you laugh and cry , to feel outrage and pride .  they present the framing and cadence for jokes , but there's nothing truly funny .  they show appropriately staged scenes of sadness , but they give you nothing to be really sad about .  as columnist molly ivins would say , it's all hat , no cattle .  the perfect opportunity arises for roach to say what this movie is really about .  there is a funeral scene , played with appropriate gravity and somber music .  it is a chance for the characters to reflect on their lives and decide what's truly important .  russell crowe steps forward to speak , about to spell out the movie's metaphor for us .  he says that what really matters in life is " community . . . . "  then adds " and hockey . "  i guess these mysterians really are as shallow as they appear .  only mildly bad , mystery , alaska probably deserves 2 stars .  i even laughed out loud , genuine laughs in places .  but i docked it an extra half star when mike myers , a friend of roach , turned up in a role that didn't suit him .  myers is a comic character actor .  he puts on masks , becomes an outrageous caricature , and is funny .  he's great as austin powers , dr . evil , or any of his scottish characters .  nobody else in mysterty , alaska is a comic caricature .  all the other people have the feel of dramatic characters in semi-serious roles .  for roach to bring in myers for a few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt toward the rest of his cast , toward his audience , and indeed toward the film itself .  it's an acknowledgment by the director that the film is not worth taking seriously .
