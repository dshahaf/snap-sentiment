the heist of a flawless , 84 carat diamond , fixed bare knuckle fights , irish gypsies and a dog are just some of the goings on in director guy ritchies's sophomore feature , " snatch . "   " lock , stock and two smoking barrels " intro'd helmer/scripter ritchie with a hyper-kinetic , in your face underworld comedy that grabbed the viewer's attention from beginning to end .  his protagonists were innocents set adrift in a see of sharks to swim or be eaten alive .  with " snatch , " the director doesn't remake his first work , but he does delve more deeply into the criminal underbelly of london , mining a rich collection of characters in the process .  >from the very beginning , " snatch " tosses you into the action with the theft of the fabulous diamond , the desire of new york gangster avi ( dennis farina ) .  en route from antwerp , diamond thief and courier frankie four fingers ( benicio del toro ) stops in london to make a separate deal with avi's partner and cousin , doug " the head " ( mike reid ) .  frankie's addiction to gambling tempts him into making a bet on an illegal boxing match for boris " the blade " ( rade sherbedgia ) , a ruthless russian mobster .  the bet turns out to be a setup for a robbery by a trio of bumbling incompetents - vinnie ( robbie gee ) , sol ( lennie james ) and portly tyrone ( ade ) - that goes miserably awry .  meanwhile , a couple of young toughs , turkish ( jason stratham ) and tommy ( stephen graham ) , are trying to break in to the boxing game with the help of local villain brick top ( alan ford ) , who also owns a pig farm .  when their first fighter is put out of action , with one punch , by a wild irish gypsy named mickey o'neil , they figure to put the loose canon in as the contender in a fixed fight .  mickey proves less than reliable and goes against turkish and tommy's deal .  brick top , impressed by mickey's performance , decides to gives them another chance - after calmly explaining that it takes 16 pigs about eight minutes to completely devour a corpse .  when avi doesn't get his precious rock , he jumps on a plane for london and hires a local legend , " bullet tooth " tony ( vinnie jones ) , to find frankie and the diamond .  things spiral out of control as all these forces head on a collision course of double-cross and double-deals - and a dog that ate a squeaky toy .  guy ritchie ( mr . madonna to some ) is an extraordinarily talented auteur who has a wonderful knack for pulling together his unique collection of cast and crew and feeding them funny and gritty dialog that spews out of the characters' mouths like machine gun fire .  the helmer marshals his large ensemble actors in a frantically paced caper comedy that makes you laugh and feel queasy at the same time , the above description by brick top being just one example .  the assemblage of actors and non-actors in rough-and-tumble settings gives " snatch " an earthy feel in its depiction of london's criminal underworld .  the cast of characters is too large to credit here , but two of the performances - first among equals , you might say - are worth noting .  alan ford is brilliant as the ruthless , evil brick top .  when he refuses sugar in his tea because " i'm sweet enough , " it makes you shiver , even as you laugh .  his is one of the best gangster characters i've seen in years .  the other outstanding perf is given by none other than brad pitt , the name actor the movie's popularity may hang upon , at least initially .  pitt , as mickey o'neil , is hard drinking , hard fighting , highly unreliable and nearly incomprehensible with a unique irish brogue and dialect of the pikers , the irish travelers of europe .  this gypsy brigand would steal the fillings from your teeth , especially if it would benefit his beloved mum ( sorcha cusack ) .  when brick top threaten the safety of mickey's family , he makes an enemy that cannot be stopped .  pitt puts a credible spin on his character and does some incredible physical stuff , too , as a bare-knuckle boxer .  the production team behind the camera includes ritchie alumni , producer matthew vaughn and lenser tim maurice-jones , and other talented technical artist that bring the hyperactive imagination of the author to visual life .  there is a patent feel to the look of " snatch " and " lock , stock and two smoking barrels " that reeks of " signature " for ritchie , but i'm not sure how this will translate in his future works .  there is so much talent in the filmmaker that i would like to see him branch out in other directions .  nonetheless , " snatch " is terrific sophomore effort , a darn good action comedy and a hoot to boot .  i give it a b+ .  
all great things come to an end , and the dot-com era embodies that perfectly .  beneath a mound of bankruptcy paperwork lies the remains of a former dot-com darling , the company kozmo . com ,  an online convenience store stocked with ice cream , porn videos , and other basic necessities of a urban dweller , all hand-delivered by couriers within an hour .  designed in 1997 by two college roommates -- joseph parks , a 27 year old goldman sachs banker , and yong kang - kozmo flamed out in three short years , raising more than $280 million in venture capital funding and from partnerships with such bigwigs as starbucks and amazon . com .  by december 1999 , the company boasted 4 , 000 employees in 11 cities , its barking ceo park attracting all kinds of media attention .  the company was set for an ipo in may 2000 . . .  until april 14 , 2000 , the day the stock market took its first big dive , ending the internet era .  by april 13 , 2001 , kozmo was out of money and ceased operations .  unlike the earlier , similar documentary startup . com , which chronicled the rise and fall of another dot-com , govworks , e-dreams focuses both on its original founders , especially park , and on the common folks that ran the day-to-day operations .  the contrast is amazing , showing how a cult persona can convince anyone that any idea is the next big thing .  the film's director , wonsuk chin ( too tired to die ) , expertly juxtaposes upper management company meetings with on-the-spot interviews with the bike messengers , general managers , and floor staff that kept kozmo humming .  the film's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise .  the most satisfying part of the film comes in understanding , to a degree , the expectations of numerous ceos commanding these titanic-type businesses .  in the film's final interviews with park , we learn what happens when the money dries up and backers don't return phone calls .  in the end , the name of the game was profit , and if you couldn't make money , even the dreamers got the axe .  screened at the 24th annual mill valley film festival .  
the booming introduction music finishes , and the camera sweeps over red mountains .  we see two figures looking over a barren , and very red landscape .  they kiss , then walk on .  one of the characters ( schwarzenegger ) slips , and falls .  the glass on his mask cracks .  his face scruches up , and his eye's begin to pop . . . . .  then doug quaid , played by schwarzenegger , wakes up .  it's all been a dream .  he wakes up next to his beautiful wife , played by stone , and the film begins . . .  total recall is a typical sci-fi film wrapped around an intresting ( if far fetched ) plot .  quaid , who has never been to mars , keeps on having dreams of the planet , which has now been colanised .  one day , while riding on a train , he's see's a ad for a company called 'rekall' , which implants memories of a holiday , instead of you actually going there yourself .  quaid chooses the 'secret agent on mars' memory , and then the s * * * really hits the fan .  the implant goes wrong , and quaid really thinks he is an agent on mars for about two minutes , until he goes back to normal and can't remember a thing .  however , everyone he knows ( his workmates , his wife ) turn against him , saying how 'blabbed about mars' and 'blew his cover on the mission' a strange man , called richter , played by ironside , wants to kill him .  quaid , now hopelessly confused , follows the advice given to him , by a 'friend' .  he get's his ass to mars .  mars is ruled by cohagen , played by cox , who charges people for air .  against him are the rebels , who are mainly mutants .  the rebel's need quaid to defeat cohagen , because quaid knows ( but can't remember yet ) about a reactor that produces air .  eventually , quaid kills cohagen , turns on the reactor , saves the planet , and goes away with a beautiful girl , just like the guy at rekall promised him .  throughout this plot , there is huge explosions , thousands of deaths ( and i mean a lot of death ) swearing , sex , and everything else that make's a good verhoeven ( director of basic instinct and starship troopers ) movie .  naturally , there's some pretty imaginative deaths , with arms getting ripped off , someone getting drilled , and heads exploding .  as you can tell , it's violent stuff .  but it's done so stylishly , and of course arnie tones it down with a one liner , that's it excusable .  the acting is variable .  arnie , of course , is useless , but he goes has some good lines , and in the first twenty minutes , he even act's like a normal bloke , not like some action hero .  stone , of course , is useless , making a pretty poor wife , and a pretty poor action hero .  but , she does sex scenes alright .  ticoton ( most recently seen in con air ) , again , is ok , doing some good action , but getting her emotions all wrong .  one minute she hates quaid , the next she loves him , and she never gets this tranisition right .  so , the good guys are awful .  but , the bad guy's are excellent .  cox is basically reprising robocop , but he's still great in this , and he delivers the best line in the whole film near the end .  ironside is superbly evil , with an utterly emotionless face .  the supporting cast are fine , and not even the comedy sidekick ( this time in the form of a taxi driver ) is annoying .  one disappointing aspect , though , are the special effects .  ilm and dreamquest do some good work ( such as a subway station scene ) but the model work is not so good .  some of the model heads look appaling fake , and quatto is a major disappointment .  another irritating thing is the product placement .  there are a lot of plugs ( and a good mars today gag ) however , the sets look great , and the special effects at the end of the film aren't too bad either .  there's also a good soundtrack running through , by jerry goldsmith ( the omen , poltergeist , star trek : the motion picture )  overall , then , total recall is a hugely violent , yet hugely enjoyable , action fest , with a reasonable plot thrown in there too , some great bad guys , and some imaganitive death .  for a schwarzenegger movie , this is not bad at all .  in fact , it's very good .  
 " last night " could have an " aka " tagged on the end of it that says , " it's the end of the world , and we feel fine " .   " last night " is about just that .  the last night of planet earth's existence .  the world is going to end at precisely midnight , january 1st , 2000 .  how scientists were so accurately able to predict when this catastrophic event would occur is never explained .  nor is the event itself .  throughout the entire movie , no explanation is given as to why this is happening .  in doing this , mckellar ( who also wrote and directed the film ) seems to be trying to transcend the genre .  he's attempted to make a film about people , and how each of them deals with their last night of life .  the film contains no science fiction elements , which allows the viewer to concentrate on the feelings and actions of the characters .  mckellar is largely successful in his attempt to rise above his material .  the film is set in toronto , and follows several people in their various escapades on the last night of existence .  there's mckellar , who plays a man who just wants to be alone when the moment occurs , but keeps getting interrupted by a woman ( sandra oh ) in search of her husband .  her husband , played by david cronenberg , is spending the day working at the gas company , informing people that they will attempt to keep providing gas right up until the end .  finally , there's mckellar's friend , played by callum keith rennie , a man who has spent his final months trying out every sexual perversion you can think of .  mckellar has crafted a gang of the some of the most interesting characters i've seen in a film in months .  these people all felt real to me , especially the character played by sandra oh .  we can see her desperation , her utter need to be with her husband in the final hours .  rennie is good , too , as the man who wants to literally try everything before he dies .  he exudes such charm and likeablity , it's not surprising that we're rooting for him to get what he wants .  but for me , the biggest surprise in the movie is mckellar .  i knew that he was a talented director , but i had no idea he could act as well .  his insistence to be alone , much to the dismay of his parents , is something that most people would find difficult to understand , but as played by mckellar , we can understand his reasons .  he doesn't buy into the whole notion that just because everyone's going to die , he should immediately find some companionship .  he realizes the relationship would be forced , and they would only be together for the sake of being together .  mckellar gives a brilliant performance , and i hope he alternates between directing and acting .  my only quibble with the film is that we never find out why the world is ending .  i really wanted to know , and my need to know was hanging over the film at all times .  i appreciate the fact that mckellar didn't want the material to rule the film , and that he wanted the movie to be more of a study in human behavious .  however , in not telling the audience what the cause of earth's destruction is , he's left a big question that is in their minds throughout the film .  another problem is we never see anybody panicking .  i would imagine if the world was ending , and there was nothing to be done about it , a large segment of the population would be going out of their minds .  instead , we are treated to shots of a giant crowd partying like it's new year's eve .  i just didn't buy the fact that everyone had completely accepted their fate .  no one had the urge to " rage against the dying of the light " .  despite these small problems , " last night " is one of the best movies of the year .  as opposed to the moronic " armageddon " , " last night " treats the subject at hand with maturity and believabilty .  and bruce willis never shows up to save the day .  
it was easy to fear the worst .  begin with a classic 1960's television series , add a big budget and an a-list star in the lead role , and stir .  script , you ask ?  who needs one , kid . . .  we've got ourselves a formula .  that was my fear : a bloated monster without any sense of direction .  then , much to my amazement , everything that could possibly go wrong . . .  didn't .  the fugitive is as lean , taut and tense as anything the action genre has produced in the last several years .  under the direction of andrew davis ( 1992's under siege ) , the fugitive grips you by the throat from the outset and never lets go .  expect box office to go through the roof , deservedly , and expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones .  the premise is a simple one .  dr . richard kimble ( harrison ford ) is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling with the real killer , a man with an artificial arm .  after an escape attempt by some other prisoners during a transfer goes awry , kimble finds himself on the run .  his one goal : to find the one-armed man ( andreas katsulas ) before u . s . marshall sam gerard ( tommy lee jones ) finds him .  where the fugitive surprises the most is the script , by jeb stuart and david twohy .  in a genre where one is almost always asked to allow leaps of logic , the script repeatedly astonished me with its intelligence , its attention to detail and its respect for the audience .  in an early sequence , kimble sneaks into a hospital to shave of his beard , slick back his hair and change into a lab coat .  on his way out , a police officer jokingly tells the man he doesn't know is kimble to zip up his pants .  it's a small moment , but it punches home the urgency of kimble's situation , and exactly what a man concerned about not being recognized might easily forget .  later , while trying to lose himself in a parade , kimble thinks to drop his overcoat , the most likely way he'd be recognized from behind .  it's these details which convince us that when a colleague of kimble's tells gerard that he's too smart to be caught , he may just be right .  credit must also be given to the special effects and stunt coordinators .  the bus crash which allows kimble's escape is a spectacular sequence , as is a leap from a dam into the water below .  the action is crisp and brutal , and never romanticized .  special kudos go to director davis for maintaining a relentless pace which underscores the single-mindedness of the two leads .  and what a pair of performances those leads are .  tommy lee jones is nothing short of brilliant as gerard , because he manages an incredibly challenging feat .  for the first third of the film , there is really no * villain * per se ; kimble is on the run , and gerard is out to find him .  it would have been very easy to turn gerard into a malevolent , vindictive inspector javert , but that never happens .  instead jones plays him as a sharp , committed man who's just doing his job , so that when he responds to kimble's comment , " i didn't kill my wife , " with a matter-of-fact , " i don't care , " we know exactly what he means .  it's not his job to determine guilt or innocence .  it's his job to bring in a fugitive .  this is a well- written character played with relish by an actor at the top of his form .  the only unfortunate thing about jones' stunning turn is that it's likely to overshadow harrison ford , and that's a shame .  for his entire career , ford has been underappreciated as an actor due to his pigeonholing as an action hero .  however , he does a fine job with the less flashy part of kimble , always keeping at the forefront the advantage this man has because of his intelligence .  the fugitive could only work to its fullest if the two protagonists always seemed to be on equal footing , and ford is up to the task .  this summer has been loaded with action/suspense films , and most of them have been doing brisk business .  however , it's time for clint , sean , and various dinosaurs to step aside .  the chase is on .  my advice is to catch it .  
no , it is not a bad film , in fact it is so good in achieving its = purpose , i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly .  event = horizon is not your run-of-the-mill sci-fi film , i'm sure many who have = watched this will agree with me .  it is not even original in that sense , = and it does borrow heavily from films like alien , hellraiser and even = blade runner .  the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and = methodical build-up that makes it wonderfully horrifying .  the story brings us to the year 2050 , where space travel have since = enormously progressed .  the event horizon is actually a ship built for a = secret experimental purpose ; it has the ability to fold time and space = thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a = man's lifetime .  the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation = but after 7 years , it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune .  a = search and rescue team led by miller ( fishburne ) is given the task to = check for survivors of the event horizon .  the designer of the ship , dr . = weir ( neill ) follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually = happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship .  event horizon is a sci-fi horror film , much truer to the word than say , = alien would ever be .  while in alien , the crew has to cope with a = ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces , in event horizon , = the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful = and horrifying .  the story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup = is superb , up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud = `enough !  i can't stand this anymore ! ' .  there are more than enough jolts = to send your adrenalin pumping overtime .  the story in itself is not = exactly something very exciting and also , the acting is only at most , = average by most commercial standards .  even so , the essence of horror is = carried out very well in this film , thanks to its well-paced = storytelling , disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences = ( which incidentally , has been quite generously removed by our censorship = board ) . =20  director paul anderson ( who did mortal kombat ) and his team of = `atmosphere' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the = bounds of the term `horror' .  this picture did not do very well in the us = box-office most probably for the dread-factor impact it has on most = audiences ; people will not see it again and not many would recommend = their friend to watch this .  although on the face of it , event horizon is = mostly molded for mass-entertainment ; many thrills , spills and suspense = to keep audiences in focus .  however , the offbeat horror element which it = ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing .  my friend and i could = not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the = `experience' of event horizon .  i guess it was just the immense feeling = of dread which the film had cast upon us .  be forewarned , this film is not for the faint-hearted nor for pure = entertainment .  be prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch = this film !  event horizon is highly recommended=85=85but at your own = risk !  it has been a long time since good-horror embraced the big screen , = and event horizon is one .  
trailing the success of brit humour in the movie industry with the likes of the semi-dramatic the commitments and the nearly slapstick a fish called wanda , the full monty is one film which delivered the depth of the former and the humour magnitude of the latter .  the film opens with a narrated documentary reel showing the improving economic and living standards of sheffield in the 60's , then cut to the harsh reality of the present .  sheffield has become some sort of a semi-slum with the only visible increase in anything was the amount of layoffs from steel-factories ; a once flourishing industry .  gaz ( carlyle ) spends most of his time in the worker's club , a sort of place where jobless people sit around to wait for job offers .  he and his `plump' friend dave ( addy ) as well as their former foreman gerald ( wilkinson ) have been sitting around the club for months without any `call for duty' .  what seemingly was just a passing hard time for gaz suddenly transformed itself into desperation when he cannot afford the 700 pounds of child-support money to his ex-wife .  suddenly finding himself facing the possiblity of losing custody of his son , he goes on to concoct an enterprising wild-idea to get the money he desperately requires .  dave and gerald too have problems of their own .  on top of his lack of employment , dave is also faced with the paranoia of his wife leaving him because of his current financial state as well as his`plump' appearance while gerald have been cheating on his wife by not telling her of his layoff for as long as 6 months , leaving home for `work' when he was actually a long-standing member of the worker's club .  there we have it ; people with real problems and a not-so-practical solution for them .  gaz manages to get the support from them and sure enough they managed to get a few other poor jobless blokes to join in their gag : to perform a strip-act at the local pub .  in gaz's own words while looking at an add for a strip-act featuring hunky `beautiful' men , `if women are willing to pay for this , they sure as well will pay for real-men' .  the full monty is very simple in nature and not a trace ambitious at all .  it is a small film which delves in the harsh-reality of unemployment and the desperation it drives people to .  it also is a very light movie to watch despite the theme it delves in because it has a lot of human-factor going for it .  never for once , was it trying to be manipulative at all , the full monty was true to itself all the way .  while the hilarity level of this film soared unexpectedly high , audience will find that they are in no way being cheated of a laugh , something lacking in many comedy films ( wannabes ? ) from hollywood .  other than carlyle , who acted as the psychotic begbie in trainspotting , the rest of the actors were definitely very new to me on-screen .  however , the acting presented in this film is more than satisfying .  carlyle's work here is a stark contrast to his character in trainspotting , implying real acting skill and flexibility on-screen .  kudos to the people involved in this film , especially to director peter cattaneo for being able to put together an excellent film which is has so much potential in ending up as your just-another-striptease .  already a critical and financial success for such a small film , the full monty is a humble film which deserves applause throughout .  while titanic managed to feast the eyes and soul in an epic way , the full monty gives one the same satisfaction ? ? . in  half the time .  
50's `aliens vs .  earth' idea revamped !  if you have been following the movie news over the net , you could not have escaped the hype over id4 .  it promises to be the summer film of the year and it has all the elements necessary .  id4 opened in the us on 2nd of july , and up till now , only after a week of release , it has nearly touched the us$100 million mark , a phenomenon last observed when jurassic park was released back in 1993 .  the premise of the movie is disgustingly simple : earth defends itself against the aliens , a typical and highly popular 50's hollywood theme which manifested itself in many films produced in that era .  the movie opens via star wars , however unoriginal it may be , it worked .  the aliens have sent a large mother ship ( supposedly to be 1/4 size of the moon ) to attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles in radius to all the major cities on earth .  the us president ( pullman ) does not know of the aliens' intention but soon finds out when david ( goldblum ) a scientist , discovers that the aliens are counting down to a synchronised attack on all the major cities .  capt . hiller ( smith ) , a hot-shot f-18 pilot are one of the hundreds assigned to take out the hovering alien attack ship over washington dc .  his squadron came under heavy alien fire after discovering that their weapons were useless against the invaders , he crash lands after a spectacular 1-on-1 chase over the grand canyon , one of the many highlights of the movie .  id4 features many characters and we are shown the impact on them as the story progresses .  acting on the whole was ok although i thought that bill pullman was a bit unsuitable for the president role but he did make a very rousing speech before sending his troops into battle ( do we smell a bit of braveheart here ? ? ) .  no prizes for guessing how id4 ends , its just plain obvious .  id4 borrows heavily from star wars , return of the jedi , alien and in some parts of the movie , i could even sense a bit of x-files on screen .  if i were to critically review this movie , id4 is full of plot holes , corny dialogue , and ridiculously dumb aliens .  however below that wafer-thin plot and on-screen flaws , id4 scored well in playing with the appealing idea of the entire world giving up their petty differences to unite themselves as one force against the alien invasion .  an idea which will have the audience strongly rooting for the united front throughout the movie , thus maintaining a screen-viewer interaction that virtually render any holes in the movie acceptable , no matter how ridiculous .  id4 was produced under a modest budget of us$68 million , a film of such magnitude would have easily been another waterworld but director roland emmerich ( universal soldier , stargate ) and producer dean devlin assembled a team which did their own special effects rather than commissioning it to ilm or any other special effects company .  some of the effects are not too good but most of it are very believable , especially the epic standoff between 150 f-18's and 250 alien saucers , reminiscence of the classic space battle featured in return of the jedi .  id4 is a movie for all .  though there are many explosions and implied deaths , there are no gory scenes of human destruction , thus young kids should be able to take it .  sit back and don't be too critical , chances are you will be absorbed into the movie just as i was .  if you are not planning to watch any movies this year , please , at least make time for this one .  this film is best watched on the big-screen .  
i was pleasantly surprised by this film .  with a budget topping $200 million , i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century's greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see .  how much could you dress up the sets ?  how many models and computer effects could you use ?  how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks ?  oh , if i've just given away part of the plot for you , go back to school .  after having viewed titanic , however , i found it to be a well-paced , well-designed , and overall well-made movie .  there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic , but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i've seen .  titanic tells its story in two time periods .  it starts out in the present , when ocean explorer brock lovett ( bill paxton ) and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic , searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship .  what they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace , which is broadcast on the news .  the woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett , who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas .  there she tells her story to lovett and his team .  in 1912 , rose dewitt bukater ( kate winslett ) , a young lady belonging to society's upper class , boards the titanic for the ship's first atlantic crossing , from southampton , england to new york .  she is engaged to cal hockley ( billy zane ) , an heir to old money , and a snob in every sense of the word .  on board , rose feels the stifling trappings of high-society's expectations , and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic's stern , but is saved from her self-proclaimed fate by jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a passenger in third-class ( " steerage " , as it's referred to ) , who talks her out of jumping .  although for rose the attraction is not immediate , a love affair soon develops between the two , which endangers rose's social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal .  the story sounds very simple , and perhaps even unexciting , but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron , a good movie comes through .  dicaprio is marvelous as the young , but worldly-wise jack , playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors .  his is a character that is immediately likable , as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations .  girls are going to swoon over him .  winslet also proves herself a good actress , delivering her lines convincingly , and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable .  the only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character's upbringing .  simply by judgment of her gait , i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper-crust debutante .  rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess , she sometimes looks positively clumsy , and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting .  billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal , since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him .  his features are such that even when he smiles , there's something mistrustful about him , and when he scowls , he is evil incarnate .  he's something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher , but a cheaper model .  like dicaprio and winslet , zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well .  backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy , cal's personal assistant ( or " man " as they said at the turn of the century ) .  no matter who else is in the cast , you can always count on a good performance by warner , who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match .  additionally , there are a number of smaller fictional and non-fictional roles thrown in for color , such as kathy bates as " the unsinkable " molly brown , danny nucci as jack's friend fabrizio de rossi , eric braeden as john jacob astor , and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie .  nice to see dr . bombay getting work .  also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die .  this by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic , but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ship's crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the first-class passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else .  in this way , titanic possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures .  you don't just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop , but a very real account of class struggle as well .  as i mentioned before , the budget for this film was tremendous , and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects .  the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail , and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic .  with regard to the exteriors , i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale .  cameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank , but only had room for 90% , and therefore had to computer-generate the remaining 40 feet .  could've fooled me and everyone else in the theater , as the splicing is seamless .  also of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning .  we are told of where the iceberg struck the ship , how the flooding occurred , the way the ship sank , and why it did so in that manner .  these technical details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts happening , and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction , in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion .  in all , james cameron's titanic is a good blend of love story , history , and action .  the fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewer's attention is held alternately by those three main elements , from the movie's intriguing beginning to it's satisfactory ending .  in box office receipts , titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship .  
 " footloose " has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel-good antics .  and i hate to admit it ; i fell for it .  the movie is about a teenager ( bacon ) who moves to a small town from the big city , and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend ( lithgow ) .  he ends up falling for the preacher's daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do .  as mentioned at the beginning of this review , " footloose " is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama .  there are virtually no surprises , and the writing is second-rate .  so why did i enjoy it so much ?  for one thing , the cast is great .  kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role .  we're rooting for him right from the start , and , unlike most films of this genre , bacon doesn't play him as the " rebel without a clue " sort .  yes , he does rebel , but he's also polite when he needs to be .  and he never broods .  the rest of the cast is equally impressive .  john lithgow , seen here playing a normal guy for a change , is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian .  but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter .  by the end of the film , we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character .  another nice touch is the music .  we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with " sexual innuendos " , but that's not true at all .  the title track , performed by kenny loggins , is upbeat and fun .  during the final sequence , i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing .  of course , i soon realized that would be a little pathetic .  anyway , " footloose " is a charming little surprise .  don't let the premise prevent you from watching it .  it sucked me in , and it'll do the same to you .  
the long and illustrious career of robin williams , which has included both forgettable turns like mrs .  doubtfire and flubber , was punctuated with the actor's first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting .  it was his first truly dramatic role since 1989's dead poets society , and critical remarks were unanimously positive .  his next role , that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come , was unfortunately lackluster .  and so , after a six-year stint as a comedic actor , the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams .  williams is the title character , hunter " patch " adams , sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean-shavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting .  we're introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies .  it's at the institution , however , that he discovers a latent talent for relating to people .  he removes himself from the institution and enrolls at the university of virginia's medical college , where he finds that medical doctrine is a calculating , impersonal trade .  his attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts with expulsion , and the movie climaxes with patch's appearance before the state medical board .  the characters are well-defined in an oscar-worthy sense .  although the script does not perform well as a narrative -- there's little story to be told outside of patch's skit-length experiences -- the script does go a long way toward building the relationships of characters .  at medical school , patch meets up with truman schiff ( daniel london ) , an outsider like himself who relishes patch's zest for humanity .  the two instantly become the best of friends , and it's easy to see why .  monica potter plays patch's love interest , a young woman who personifies the things that patch hates about medical school .  for some reason he's attracted to her , and although it never gets said , the audience understands from an intrinsic point of view .  the script -- based on hunter adams' own story -- works well this way .  the rest of the cast , bob gunton as the villain professor in particular , is solid .  director tom shadyac ( liar liar ) leads us in and out of patch's life in a sound , intentional manner ; combined with williams' presence on screen , the movie rarely becomes boring .  patch adams' lack of purpose is its major shortcoming , and for the first ninety minutes out of two hours , there's little feeling of continuity or the passage of time .  nevertheless , it's an emotionally moving picture , and patch adams looks to be one of the more memorable of the holiday season .  it succeeds at everything it tries , and only fails at the stuff it doesn't try in the first place .  by and large there may be another oscar nomination herein for williams , but more importantly , it's entertainment for the entire family .  
titantic , writer and director james cameron's much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200 , 000 , 000 epic , arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises , whether the film is worth it ?  as a business proposition , it seems hard to see how it can ever break even , but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful .  if you've already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure , think again .  the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world's most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers .  in either case , it is filmmaking at its best .  when we entered the press screening , my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long .  he said no but that the time would go by so fast she'd never notice the length .  amazingly , he was right .  titanic is one of the few long films that doesn't suffer because of it .  the lush picture , filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm , opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean .  fortune hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) leads the expedition looking for the world's most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship , known back then as " the ship of dreams . "  the necklace's hundred-year-old former owner , rose dewitt bukater ( gloria stuart ) , finds brock to tell him her story .  although almost all of the movie happens in flashback , one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk .  using a computer simulation , the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later , which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing .  after twenty minutes , the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage .  in a classic movie theme , the two parts of the ship , first class and steerage ( third-class ) exist in sharp contrast .  the strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing .  entering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance , cal hockley , played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane .  and thanks to a last minute winning poker hand , an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class .  even with her own promenade deck , rose feels trapped on the ship , what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes .  in contrast , jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board .  after jack saves rose from committing suicide , they start a brief but impassioned love affair .  never tawdry and rarely explicit , their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story .  leonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma .  in so many ways , small and large , he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part .  when he confronts cal , for example , he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal's supercilious put-downs .  kate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose .  the chemistry between these two academy award nominees , him for what's eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility , is nothing short of astonishing .  from the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship's bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude , they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances .  if the film breaks after an hour and a half , which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up , you will still get one of the best films of the year .  peter lamont's sets are more than authentic .  one scene , for example , starts with the planning-to-retire captain , played with insouciance by bernard hill , having his tea on deck .  it then shifts to the ship's massive gears and then to the bright-hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals .  the handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner .  easily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest .  at first , since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull , not some big gaping hole , the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else .  what a lark .  we've struck an iceberg .  now let's get back to our brandy and cigars .  the ship's musicians play like troopers through it all , even after the panic sets in .  after all , they see it as their duty to calm the passengers .  when the musicians are about to die , they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together , and they mean it .  their civility borders on insanity , but it is touching nevertheless .  the story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface .  there are more than enough characters to love and to hate , and all of the casting is dead-on .  special effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable .  in titanic , for which he created a nine-tenths scale model of the entire ship , cameron strove for accuracy at all costs .  the most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two , and the front section becomes vertical in the water .  people are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately .  besides being romantic and dramatic , the script includes liberal doses of humor .  from the many deliciously subtle verbal put-downs to the physical comedy , as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man , the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears .   " it's good-bye for a little while , " a less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first .   " this boat's for mommies and children .  there'll be a boat in a little while for daddies . "  basically there was a design decision to have fewer than half of the necessary life boats -- it made the decks look too crowded otherwise .  perhaps the sinking is best summarized by one of the guggenheim's on-board the ship .  in the dining room with the lifeboats gone and the ship certain to sink , he is offered a life jacket by one of the crew .   " no thanks , " the elegantly attired guggenheim replies .   " we're dressed in our best and would prefer to go down like gentlemen .  but we would like a brandy . "  titanic runs 3 : 14 .  it is rated pg-13 for tastefully and delicately presented sex and nudity and would be fine for kids twelve and up .  
the grandfather of italian horror the late mario bava has credits in nearly 100 films and tv movies produced in italy between 1939 and his death in the early 80's .  more practiced as a cinematographer than a director , bava nonetheless sat in the director's chair for beyond the door ii , the project which turned out to be his last full-length feature film .  alongside the appalling zombie schlock of hacks like lucio fulci , beyond the door ii is simply a revelation .  in his day bava was considered by most to be no great filmmaker , yet here he fashioned one of the finest italian horror movies of the 1970's .   ( note that the film has no connection with the 1975 exorcist-rip off behind the door , but for some unexplained reason was given this related title for release in the usa and australia . )  this story focuses on dora , a women set upon by a malevolent spirit that channels itself through her young son marco .  the film opens with dora , her son and second husband bruno returning to a house by the sea that was the scene of her first husband's suicide and her subsequent trauma 7 years earlier .  they hope to put the past behind them , but as small accidents start to befall dora - usually while bruno is away on business - she starts to suspect that marco ( played with uncanny ability by 8 year old david colin jr . ) is somehow involved in the strange goings on .  to reveal any more of the story would be unfair .  suffice to say that this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot , loads of atmosphere and solid acting , though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english .  bava coaches a surprisingly good performance from the usually wooden daria nicolodi , wife of famed italian horror director dario argento .  her character is invested with sufficient depth to allow the audience real empathy with dora's troubled soul .  the music by italian ensemble libra is also effective , mixing odd-sounding 70's rock with classic gothic piano sequences .  and there is at least one moment - brilliantly engineered by bava - that is guaranteed to lift you ten feet out of your chair .  yet for italian horror , the bloodletting here is surprisingly minimal .  lamberto bava and francesco barbieri's script is more concerned with deeper , psychological terrors , with themes of guilt and suffering , with the notion that what we sow will shall - somewhere , somehow - eventually reap .  scholars of the genre take note : beyond the door ii is stylish , chilling , and essential .  
martin scorsese's kundun , which chronicles roughly the first twenty years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama , has been criticized for its lack of narrative structure .  personally , i don't think it needs one : it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china .  scorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do , as a larger-than-life symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership : the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences , but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal .  the set design and cinematography are outstanding , and while scorsese occasionally seems to get carried away with the spectacle , it helps to augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels to china to meet chairman mao .  political art sometimes succumbs to the temptation to start shouting slogans , kundun does not : it succeeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way and without being overly manipulative .  
in some regards , making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it .  try too hard , and it snaps ; but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther .  in simon birch , director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique : he takes advantage of caution and poise , but also risks his movie with a few bold steps .  in the end , he's not only holding an unbroken band , but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature .  there's no doubt about it : the film that johnson has crafted is rich .  he chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown , maine - leaves turn bright orange in the fall , the grass is a lush green , pure white snow falls in the winter , and the sky goes on forever .  the characters continue that turn : our two leads are simon birch ( ian michael smith ) and joe wenteworth ( joseph mazzello ) .  simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital , and by age twelve he's only two feet tall .  joe is the bastard son of rebecca ( ashley judd ) , and by age twelve he's ready to know who is father is .  naturally , the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together , from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball .  in a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith , simon birch is convinced that he's god's instrument , and there must be a reason he's so small .  joe doesn't quite buy it , but he sticks by simon ; the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each other's only true friends .  early on , the two meet up with ben goodrich ( oliver platt ) , rebecca's new boyfriend , and although the bond isn't immediate , ben and the two boys develop a liking for each other .  both platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability .  the audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon , a testament to the acting jobs of both .  finally , jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day , and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show .  mark steven johnson's sense of drama and writing is fantastic .  the script is loosely based on john irving's novel , a prayer for owen meany , but it's so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from 'based on' to 'suggested by . '  along those same lines , it's almost unfitting to compare the two ; johnson uses tension , humor , atmosphere , and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions .  by no means has he developed a project of similar popularity - gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks - but the winning idea remains the same .  simon birch is a different look at a different life , and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come .  in the present , however , it's an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at .  
screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker .  screenplay by andrew kevin walker .  inspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving .  directed by tim burton .  starring johnny depp , christina ricci , and casper van dien .  special appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken .  synopsis : investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation .  townspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them .  cute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery .  comments : tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years .  batman , of course , is perhaps his best-known film and led to a string of less successful sequels .  he's done biographical work ( on the director ed wood ) , children's movies ( nightmare before christmas ) , and a homage to alien invasion movies ( mars attacks ! ) .  sleepy hollow , his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while , shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies .  sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s , especially hammer studios' reworkings of dracula and frankenstein , and american international's series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe .  christopher lee , in fact , star of many hammer productions over the years , appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders .  the movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s .  one of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein .  i mention these allusions for a reason .  seasoned horror film fans , including myself , will smile at their inclusion in this film .  with the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies , especially the blair witch project ( the most overblown turkey of the decade ) , we needed a film like this .  not only does it have a sense of history , but burton's skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror .  the film's eerie landscapes and foggy towns , indeed , overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie .  johnny depp , a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands , plays ichabod crane , who has apparently changed occupations from irving's original story and is now an investigator .  depp is adequate in his role .  no more ; no less .  equally adequate is christina ricci , who plays the love interest in the film .  she's a good witch too .  how cute .  one of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters .  the two actors , however , carry the movie well enough , but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine .  veteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough ( who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks ) are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers .  while i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points , i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing .  you have to pay attention .  andrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay .  he's the one who also wrote 8 mm and seven .  walker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood , and sleepy hollow certainly doesn't hurt his growing reputation .  as one might imagine from a gentleman like walker , sleepy hollow is quite graphic .  there's a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings .  this is definately not a flick to take the young kids to .  a lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25 - 30 minutes covering the youngest's eyes with her hand .  he was obviously upset by the movie's intense violence .  if you're looking for a good scare , however , sleepy hollow is definately recommended .  
first , i am not a big fan of the x-files tv series .  i have nothing against it particularly , i just don't happen to watch it .  having said that , i can now say that i liked the x-files pretty well .  for us non-fans , there's nothing big going for it , but there are a lot of little things .  the movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35 , 000 b . c .  two proto-humans enter the cave and find a space alien cocooned inside .  the alien breaks free and kills one man in a struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien .  the movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy ( lucas black , from sling blade ) is captured by the same black ooze .  we then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder ( gillian anderson and david duchovny ) , who have been pulled off of their previous assignment ( investigations into the paranormal ) and put onto the bomb squad detail .  a caller has threatened a federal building in dallas , texas .  on a hunch , mulder checks out the building across the street , and , wouldn't you know it , he turns out to be right .  the fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not in time to defuse .  five people die in the blast , and when mulder learns who the victims were , a light bulb goes on over his head .  the two agents team up to investigate , against fbi orders , the links mulder has made .  their search leads them back to the north texas cave , all across the country , and even to antarctica as they get closer and closer to " the truth . "  the plot , and " the truth , " are uninspired .  i got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me .  it didn't .  the possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them .  but the point of the x-files is not what the truth is , but the extent to which it has been hidden .  it's a slightly more interesting angle , but it still raises expectations about that " truth " too high .  if this were the whole film , i would say the movie was mediocre , perhaps even boring .  but there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it .  the pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest .  before the audience can get tired of one location , the agents follow a hot tip to another location , and so on and so forth .  the locations are not all computer-generated sets , either .  there are some artificial settings , but the desert night of nevada , the edge of suburbia in texas , and the endless fields of snow in antarctica ( actually somewhere in north america . )  make this fantastic film feel more real .  ward russell's cinematography is very good .  the overall look is dark and ominous , appropriate to the intended tone of the film's plot .  russell is able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding .  when the movie is set in darkness , the picture quality is still rich and detailed .  finally , and specifically , there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train .  i don't know if the shot is faked in any way , but it looks dangerous , and it looks great .  the movie's soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film . ( skip  to the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie - there is a spoiler in the following sentences . ) during the opening prehistoric sequence , a howling wind dogs the soundtrack , never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound .  in one of the movie's most effective sequences , metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud of buzzing bees .  the visuals of the scene are good , but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound .  there was no question as to who the movie's stars would be .  even so , duchovny and anderson are an interesting pair of actors and a good combination .  both are easy on the eyes and together , they have some good timing , banter , and energy .  there is a hint of chemistry between them , but it never gets in the way of their professional relationship .  they are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street .  there might be some romantic interest , but for now they're more interested in their environs than they are in each other .  no single element really makes this movie outstanding - not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular .  but enough things were done right that the x-files is one of the more interesting summer adventures to come along .  
there's a thin line between satire and controversy , and mike nichols ( the birdcage , wolf ) has directed a sharp and very honest look at a us presidential election .  based on the book written by " anonymous " ( actually former " newsweek " writer joe klein ) , john travolta plays governor jack stanton .  but he doesn't actually play stanton .  he plays bill clinton ; just the same as emma thompson no doubt plays the first lady and billy bob thorton is the campaign manipulator james carville ( although the credits will of course say otherwise ) .  the film is taken from the perspective of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , a morally correct and somewhat hesitant new advisor to stanton .  he searches for justice and dignity in the ugliest possible situations , and whether it be keeping the history of his boss' pants under wraps or contemplating digging up dirt on another politician , he approaches his work with a keen desire to skillfully serve his country and his fellow workers .  richard jemmons ( billy bob thorton ) and daisy green ( maura tierney ) team up with henry as the would-be president's advisors , and hire lesbian veteran libby holden ( kathy bates ) as the campaign's eccentric " tougher than dirt " incriminator .  together they face all sorts of sexual allegations , the irritatingly discourteous media and other witty politicians in the election race .  in its satire and controversy , primary colors is a similar film to wag the dog : they both are not afraid to wipe their noses in the nitty-gritty and take a bold look at something that will never has honesty as a virtue .  but whereas wag showed us how much affect a few people can have on the media , primary colors is much more concerned with fleshing out it's characters , letting us understand what they want and why , and making us truly appreciate the humanity and rectitude that they graciously represent .  seeing john travolta play bill clinton so confidently and justly is enough to make the film more than worth a look .  and the rest of the cast also make superb performances - adrian lester sharply portrays the intellect of henry whilst kathy bates is perfect as the robust and energetic libby holden .  at occasions , you can't help but feel that these terrific characters are going to waste .  there are long slabs of time where john travolta ( unquestionably the most interesting to watch ) is missed from the screen ; and since it is awkwardly structured as henry's story we are often forced to watch scenes that perhaps are not so necessary to the central plot - or even the point of the film .  having said that , make no mistake - primary colors is always enjoyable to watch .  but frequently we have to ask ourselves - exactly what are we watching ?  most of the first half of its duration is a lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations that seem so genuine we cannot help but laugh , but the way primary colors chooses to finish tackles aspects that are very contrary , and almost unsuitable , to the rest of the film .  but as i mentioned before , there is a thin line between satire and controversy - and for the most part , primary colors delivers an entertaining indulgence of political matters combined with a far-from-overpowering look at winning the public's opinion .  although at occasions the film may jump around a little too freely , focus is never lost on how important and vulnerable the subject matter really is .  thankfully , it is clear to make the distinction on what is entertaining movie cosmetics and what is a provocative documentation of something so really it's scary .  
at first glance , three kings looks to be just another war movie , the 90s version of all those favourite war movies with names i cannot remember .  the 90s version , it definitely is , just another war movie ?  not in your dreams !  imagine pulp fiction approach to saving private ryan , thats three kings for you .  believe it or not , it bears the cool of the former and the stark humane meaning of the latter .  the story brings us to the twilight of the gulf war , with the allied troops victorious .  majpr archie gates ( clooney ) leads an enterprising bunch of grunts to a rather unorthodox post-war looting spree ; the millions in gold bars secretly stowed away by saddam in a desolate village in the desert .  as the rest of the troops are celebrating their victory and getting ready to be shipped home , this `wild bunch goes awol on an armed hum-vee ( the vehicle of choice of the us army ) .  they soon find out that they have much resistance , as they get tangled with the local rebellion against saddams forces .  frequently switching their modes between looters and robin hoods merry men , they become consciously attacked by their own morals .  as the film begins to roll , it seemed to have a rather `light mood to it .  `special effects such as when gates describes to his men how a bullet can kill simply paves the way for a light-hearted funny action movie .  three kings is much smarter than that .  as the conflict becomes more and more complex , the audience will be trapped in a limbo , trying to stay focussed on that light-mood/serious-mood that the film seem to portray .  i personally found this analogous to the same feelings of the main characters involved in the film ; trapped between their initial plan paved by greed and their own sense of humanity .  this simply made the entire experience of watching three kings truly brilliant .  action sequences are not shot as your old-fashioned war films nor anything like steven spielbergs in-your-face war violence .  they are carefully built to generate tension with just the right tight close-ups and pauses , right before the action starts .  not john woo for sure but more of sergio leones spaghetti western style ( tons of them starring clint eastwood ) .  great performances by clooney and wahlberg but the brilliance have to lie in the conception of this film ; the screenwriter and the director .  three kings ranks among the best films of the year , well , for me at least .  highly recommended .  
most sequels don't do what they're supposed to do like " toy story 2 " does .  far too many of them end up re-hashing the original and adding very little .  is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors ?  thankfully , " toy story 2 " is a wonderful exception .  i can't remember the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one .  it's yet another sign that pixar , the acclaimed animation studio behind " toy story " and " a bug's life , " is still at the top of its game .  woody and buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit " toy story , " and things have changed a bit since the last one ended .  woody ( voiced by tom hanks ) is preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp .  in his absence , he has assigned buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , now comfortable in his role as a toy , to take charge .  unfortunately , woody's trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale , and is stolen by an over-zealous toy collector ( wayne knight ) .  off to save him are buzz and members of the old " toy gang , " including mr . potato head ( don rickles ) , rex the nervous dinosaur ( wallace shawn ) , hamm the piggy bank ( john ratzenberger ) , and slinky dog ( jim varney ) .  while in captivity , woody makes a startling discovery : he is actually part of a collection of toys based on a 1950's children's show entitled " woody's roundup . "  he meets the show's other characters , which include jesse ( joan cusack ) , his cowgirl sidekick , the wise old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) , and bullseye , his trusty horse .  they have all been anxiously awaiting woody's arrival , as once their set is completed , they will be sold to a japanese toy museum , and finally escape storage forever .  this means woody now faces a difficult choice .  with his friends coming to rescue him , does he go with them and spend a few more years with andy , or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever ?  as in the original film , " toy story 2 " contains first-rate animation , and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there .  reportedly , the film was originally slated for a direct-to-video release , but after seeing the improvements that had been made , disney rightly decided to release it into theaters .  the film is well worth seeing on the big screen .  the colors are bright , the textures sharp , and even the human characters look more " human . "  the animation is consistently seamless , with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable .  there are so many impressive sequences that i'd find it impossible to list them here , but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al' s toy barn , the store owned by woody's captor .  pixar's rendition of the family dog is also nicely done , with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it .  the voice work is also perfectly complementary , and as with the first movie , does much to help further character development .  tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz , making you forget who is doing the voice .  it was woody and buzz up there , not tom and tim .  all the cast members from the original reprise their roles , and each is excellent .  several new voices have been added , with joan cusack , kelsey grammer , and wayne knight doing fine work .   " toy story 2 " is strong in characterization , and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie .  woody faces difficult choices , while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn't yet realized his status as a toy , forcing him to see what he used to be like .  the new characters are also developed quite well , especially jesse , who narrates a sarah mclachlan-aided flashback illustrating how she was loved , then forgotten by her owner .  it may be computer-animated , and it may have sappy music , but it's downright touching .  the script , despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers , is endlessly clever and inventive , especially considering that it's a sequel .  the reason " toy story 2 " works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original's success by re-doing the same story and using the same characters .  not this one .  we get character change , new characters , and new issues brought up .   " toy story 2 " is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself .  there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here .  the humor is sharp and witty , with something to amuse both kids and adults .  there are funny asides to films such as " star wars " and " jurassic park , " among others , new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock 'em sock 'em robots , and appearances from other pixar efforts " a bug's life " and the 1997 short " geri 's game . "   ( geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody's broken arm . )  the action is fast and furious , and the chases ( in the street , in a toy store , in an elevator , on a baggage carousel , and in an airplane ) keep getting bigger and better .   " toy story 2 " never grows stagnant , because there is always something new to hold your interest .  the more you pay attention to it , the more rewarding it is .  it's rare to see a film like " toy story 2 " come along , because it's the kind of film that's almost impossible to dislike .  it's created purely to entertain , and though i enjoy a thought-provoking drama as much as the next person , it's nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do : send us out with a smile .  it's a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing " toy story 2 . " it's the rare sequel that manages to expand on , and live up to , the original .  
unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi , an artist whose palette is fabric .  ostensibly , the film is a documentary , but use of that term requires stretching its meaning .  many scenes appear staged , and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room .  the cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium , and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) .  director douglas keeve ( who was mizrahi's lover at the time ) freely admits that he " couldn't care less about the truth " but was more interested in capturing " the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion . "  despite violating nearly every rule of " legitimate " documentary film making , however , unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment .  while it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry , it presents a fascinating , if incomplete , picture of designer mizrahi .  this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study -- he's funny , energetic , and eminently quotable .  he has unusual views on just about everything , from fashion ( " it's about women not wanting to look like cows " ) to mary tyler moore ( " between her and jackie kennedy , they shaped this country " ) to style ( " it's almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs " ) .  unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress .  it's almost certainly different that anyone would imagine .  the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look , including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies , then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection .  in particular , unzipped traces mizrahi's development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show , which highlights a number of prominent models , including cindy crawford , naomi campbell , kate bush , and linda evangelista .  on the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped .  a variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color .  there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie , and , during the climactic fashion show , color is used to show the audience's perspective , while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences .  nevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment .  while unzipped isn't an expose on the fashion industry per se , keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear .  overall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else , and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed .  when the designer declares that " everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that's beautiful and liberating , " it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed .  
i recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years .  it was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood .  but of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years , i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex .  yes , more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me , trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster .  for all teenagers , it's almost like a rite of passage .  and what we did was sometimes downright nasty , sometimes funny , and sometimes shocking .  and all of that is terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer .  `american pie' is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school year .  just how great are their hormones raging ?  one of them notes , after watching disney's the little mermaid , that ariel is soooo hot .  the four schoolmates are kevin , oz , finch and jim .  kevin is the only one with a steady girlfriend , but doesn't want to have sex until the time is just right .  but what is the perfect time ?  there is just no way to know , and that frightens him .  oz is the big jock who decides that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them and to be more sensitive .  he joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages .  finch is the phobic hermit who doesn't stand a chance with any girl .  so , he pays someone $200 to start spreading rumors about his prowess .  suddenly , girls are lining up to go out with him .  but among these friends , it is jim that is the most curious and the most fearful .  when he has a chance to romp with a pretty exchange student , his inexperience comes shining through .  he has much to learn , and will do anything to seek out this kind of knowledge .  this may include watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with mom's apple pie in a scene that is completely shocking , raunchy , yet unbelievably funny .  the one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its `r' rating .  there is stuff in here that is completely gross in the same manner that `there's something about mary' was gloriously ribald .  in fact , at first this film received a sinful nc-17 rating before a couple of more cuts finally brought it down to a teen-accessible rating .  but i guess after seeing the no-holds-barred coarseness of south park , this seems tame by comparison .  teens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh hardest .  but unlike many teen sex comedies , there is a genuine intelligence at work here .  these are four normal boys who have a natural curiosity about sex .  their plans of action are thoughtful and they think about the consequences .  they know what they want , yet temper it with responsibility .  but almost always , it's impossible to know how to fight the invisible monster , and it's these episodes that make `american pie' such a carnal delight to watch .  
>from the man who presented us with henry : the portrait of a serial killer ( 6 . 5/10 )  comes a wild tale set within the elite and white trash of florida's south coast .  plot : guidance counselor ( dillon ) is accused of raping one of his students .  she happens to be the daughter of one of the wealthiest women in florida .  the counselor is brought to court on the charges , as another white trash girl ( campbell ) , also joins the rape finger-pointing club .  as the story unfolds , we find that many things aren't exactly as they seem ( that's as much as i could say without ruining anything ) .  critique : good little flick that slows down at certain points , and runs a tad long , but generates enough twists and turns to keep most people interested throughout .  mind you , i could see many people not liking it because it takes " one too many " twists and turns , but hey , i happen to like that kind of thing .  and besides , the twists and turns in this movie managed to remain within the realm of believability ( or scathingly close to ) , and even " explained " many of its turns with a showcase of missed scenes during the credit crawl at the end of the film ( do not leave the theatre before you see the credits . . . it  really does clear up some stuff ! ! ) .  other than that , the acting was good , with campbell transforming her " good girl stereotypical " role into a pot-smoking , goth-looking white trash chick out for a good time .  denise richards ( from starship troopers ( 7/10 ) fame ) solidifies herself as hollywood's jelly-donut pinup girl of the moment , and proves that all breast implants needn't lead to lawsuits .  bacon is solid , and so is dillon ( while continuing to prove his inability to age to the whole wide wondering world ! ! ) .  sprinkle the story with a bunch o' shots of alligators peeking through the swamp waters , bacon showing the world the size of his ding-dong ( do we really need to see this ? ? ) , a couple of lesbian kissing scenes , and a menage-a-trois , and you've got yourself a decent time at the movie theatre .  on the down side , the soundtrack was not as prominent ( or slick ) as i thought it would be , and theresa russell ( real name : theresa paup ) seems to have lost her way in every which way possible . . . . ooooh ,  i almost forgot bill murray's exquisite role as the down-trodden lawyer who agrees to defend dillon in court .  murray actually added that extra little spice of humour that allowed this film to affirm its position as a quirky little noirish tale of sex , greed and mystery .  little known facts : neve campbell specified a non-nudity clause in her contract ( she's also born in guelph , ontario . . . go  hoser ! )  director john mcnaughton says he deleted a scene that would have shown matt dillon and kevin bacon showering together , as it was gratuitous .  kevin bacon plays in a band with his brother , called the bacon brothers , is married to actress kyra sedgwick , and has a game based on him called " six degrees of kevin bacon " .  
let's face it : the $100 million-plus smash that was " goldeneye " was not a good film by any means , and as a bond movie was only marginally better than , say , " a view to a kill " or either of the timothy dalton pictures , by virtue of nice pacing .  but it did revive the series , and granted the producers some new directions in which to take the it ( ie .  the new " m " is a woman ) .   " tomorrow never dies " is the picture " goldeneye " should have been ; it's also the most entertaining bond outing since " the spy who loved me " .  the new picture opens with china considering war with britain after a standard military operation is misconstrued as a hostile threat from an english submarine .  as an attack occurs , the front-page headline is already being prepared , courtesy of carver media .  carver ( pryce ) the man is a deluded magnate , a sort of hybrid of ted turner , bill gates , and peter sellars' german scientist from " dr .  strangelove " ( physically , pryce even recalls sellars in his kubrick days ) .  it's up to james bond to take him down , with assistance , of course , from a wealth of gadgets ( including a multi-purpose cell phone ) , and beautiful women .  enter michelle yeoh , fresh from " supercop " , as a chinese secret agent with her own agenda ; with effortless grace , she cat burgles , dispatches baddies seemingly with the ease of preparing pasta , and refuses the advances of our philandering hero .  they make a great team .   " tomorrow never dies " is a surprisingly entertaining and efficient film , given that at the helm is none other than the director of " turner & hooch " .  spottiswoode has crafted some breathtaking set pieces , each much more intricate and impressive than , for instance , the tank scene in " goldeneye " .  moreover , brosnan has at last settled into the role some feel he was born to play ; last time out , the fate of the franchise rested on his shoulders , and there was noticeable discomfort in his body language .  returned in brosnan's eyes has some of the playfulness he demonstrated for so many years on tv's " remington steele " , as has his deadpan wit .  and though carver's motives are muddy ( when carver explains that " genius is insanity with some success " , screenwriter fierstein is taking a lazy shortcut ) , pryce makes an agreeable , memorable villain .  in the future , they should pursue actors as talented and experienced as pryce to breathe life into these cardboard figures .  there a few too many explosions in " tomorrow never dies " , perhaps so many they qualify as dialogue .  and it could have used a sharper script , though i was amused by the double entendres , none of which i will reveal here .  as it stands , the plot suffers many holes ( i'm not taking about implausibilities ) , and the dialogue tends towards the hackneyed .  now that the elements are in place : modern special effects and stunt work , cool pierce brosnan , kickass female allies . . .  it's time to put them to use in something truly special .  there's no mistaking , however , that " tomorrow never dies " is ideal holiday escapism , and for the first time in perhaps years , you'll walk out wanting more bond movies .  -reviewed december 17 , 1997  
today , war became a reality to me after seeing a screening of saving priivate ryan .  steve spielberg goes beyond reality with his latest production .  the audience is tossed about the theatre witnessing the horror of war .  please keep the kids home as the r rating is for reality .  tom hanks is stunning as capt john miller , set out in france during ww ii to rescue and return home a soldier , private ryan ( matt damon ) who lost three brothers in the war .  spielberg at time takes us inside the heads of these individuals as they face death during the horrific battle scenes .  private ryan is not for everyone , but i felt the time was right for a movie like this to be made .  the movie reminds us of the sacrifices made by our ww ii fighting men and women .  we must not ever forget them as many gave the ultimate sacrifice , their lives so that we may live in freedom today .  for this i thank them and for steve spielberg for making a movie that i will never forget .  the academy will not forget tom hanks come april 1999 , as another well deserved oscar with be in tom's posession .  
roman emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) chooses his trusted general maximus ( russell crowe ) as his successor .  however the emperor's evil son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) murders his father before the announcement can be made , and maximus ( as well as his family ) is sentenced to be executed .  maximus is able to escape his executioners , but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo ( oliver reed ) .  proximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money ( he being a former gladiator himself ) , and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator .  when emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum , proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle .  maximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus .  gladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army and germania , and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required " 40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence " style of moviemaking .  the only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used . . .  it's choppy slow-motion which is unsettling and distracting .  it's similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan , but nowhere near as effective .  the actual gladiator battles are thrilling , but also a bit disjointed .  many times it's unclear as to exactly what's going on . . .  all the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled .  we're not sure who's blood or by who's hand though .  there's an instance of this earlier in the film too that's disappointing .  it's comes when maximus escapes his executioners .  some flashes and a few quick cuts later and maximus is free . . .  but i still don't know exactly how he did it .  russell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995's virtuosity .  for whatever reason his stardom never arrived . . .  but he should have it now .  from here on moviegoers should now be able to say , " let's go see the new russell crowe movie " .  he gets the best scene in the film ( and one of the best moments of all recent movies ) when he reveals his identity to commodus in the colisseum .  it's both rousing and chilling .  joaquin phoenix does a very effective job of making commodus a person and not just a cartoon character ( which could have easily happened ) .  commodus is conniving , sneaky and whiny , but phoenix never lets the character get silly .  it's a very good ( and very creepy ) performance .  oliver reed died during the filming of gladiator , and it's a huge loss to the acting world .  i've always been fascinated with reed . . .  he's one of those very talented performers who once had a fine career but ended up in direct to video junk during his twilight years .  it's ironic that this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies again , as he gives a fun and sincere performance .  the film is dedicated to him , and he will surely be missed .  reed's death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem , as he still had scenes to be completed .  rather than recast the role ( and end up reshooting a great deal of footage ) , a digital version of oliver reed was created at a reported cost of 2 million dollars .  ironically , that was probably more money than reed ever earned for a single film .  anyway , this digital effect is only used in one scene that i am aware of ( for about twenty seconds ) and if you aren't looking for it you won't even be able to tell .  some of the other digital effects are less convincing however . . .  and like i always say , noticable digital effects take me out of a movie immediately .  it's sad that such a good film has these distractions .  movies like the fall of the roman empire and spartacus seemed to do okay without the use of computer effects .  keep in mind that gladiator is based on real people and real events , but is entirely a work of fiction .  however it's a work of fiction that's great entertainment , and another film to add to the list of damn fine flicks released in 2000 a . d .  
written by john grisham and robert altman ( as al hayes )  directed by robert altman  some time ago , a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel .  the novel was a summer smash , topping best-seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads .  the only problem : the novel wasn't very good .  it was far more pulp than pulitzer .  but the director realized that , no matter how pedestrian the prose , this book really grabbed people - that the author , while not a great writer , was a fantastic storyteller .  so he took on the project , convinced he could make something happen on screen .  the director ?  francis ford coppola .  the book , of course , was mario puzo's the godfather .  the rest , as they say in showbiz , was history .  by bringing up the godfather , i don't mean to suggest that robert altman's the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness .  but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material .  can you get any more questionable than john grisham ?  depends on whom you ask .  but there's no question that grisham's work grabs people .  like puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who can't tell a well-constructed story from a can of spam .  so something in grisham's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america's greatest living filmmakers .  the result is a gripping thriller that , while falling short of classic cinema , deserves its place in the altman canon .  >from its opening shot to the closing credits , the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread , with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe .  this terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch .  witness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear .  we roll over the hills into the town of savannah , then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone .  right away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises .  pay attention , boys and girls - this shot was not conceived by john grisham , but by altman .  this is what a great director can do for questionable source material .  the sports car belongs to rick magruder ( kenneth branagh ) , the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases .  magruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office .  outside after the party he meets one of the waitresses , mallory doss ( embeth davidzt ) , just as she realizes her car has been stolen .  driven by southern chivalry , a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress , magruder offers her a ride home .  there he learns more about mallory's life than he bargained for .  her car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon ( robert duvall ) , a ted kyzynski-style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter .  magruder , perhaps influenced by mallory's decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him , is sympathetic to her plight , and offers to help her get her father committed - right after he sleeps with her , of course .  this simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end .  he succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital , and for a moment all appears well .  but then dixon's crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup - and suddenly magruder finds himself , mallory and his own children in danger .  the cops won't lift a finger to help a liberal attorney .  his only allies are his faithful assistant lois ( daryl hannah ) and his bumbling private-eye sidekick clyde ( robert downey jr ) .  if this predicament wasn't bad enough , hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos .  altman may provide the atmosphere , but branagh's performance holds the gingerbread man together .  an accomplished actor when he isn't directing himself in vanity productions , branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives .  is his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness , or of egotism ?  magruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it - and by then it's too late .  as the plot unfolds , magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are .  and life is never so bad that it can't get worse .  if you're familiar with altman's work , you'll recognize several of his signature techniques .  characters are not introduced in establishing shots , but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent .  crucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows , making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action .  dialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style .  and of course there's my favorite altman technique - the obligatory nude actress shot .  thanks to altman , here are some of the actresses i've had the pleasure of seeing naked : sally kellerman , julianne moore , madeline stowe , even frances mcdormand .  and now i can add embeth davidtz , who looks quite healthy in the altogether .  the naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film .  is it old-school sexism , or a clever in-joke ?  you be the judge .  but back to the picture at hand .  in the hands of a mere mortal , the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller , no better or worse than the countless others we've all endured .  in the hands of a master like altman , it becomes an exercise in existential doom , in its own way far more successful than scorsese's cape fear remake , which tried for the same result .  what may prevent it from enduring with altman's greatest work is a weak third act - in fact , there really is no third act in grisham's story , so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up .  but there are true moments of riveting suspense , and great performances by branagh , davidzt and downey jr - more than enough to see you through .  that polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman , and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back , should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are .  they probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill .  and that , my friends , should make you very afraid .  
we share the descent into darkness of a talented boy pianist .  years later we see his subsequent resurfacing ; in the mid 80's a damaged man walks out of a rainstorm and back into the world .  the movie charts the causes of his mental breakdown .  based on the life story of david helfgott , this australian film is a rich exploration of the pressures drilling in upon a child-genius , compounded by the looming shadow of a domineering father .  in the 1950's helfgott emerged as a child prodigy .  the film traces his relationship with his father , whose encouragement comes at the cost of demanding david have no life beyond that of the black and white keys .  david is offered places in the usa , but his father refuses to let him leave australia .  the effect this has upon helfgott is cleverly told via a single reverse tracked shot ; david is sobbing on the front doorway of his music teacher's house .  he is well lit via the external house lights .  his teacher isn't home .  we pull back and see that the dark front room's window has it's curtains open .  there , in a pool of blackness , is a grand piano .  david's fall over the dark cliff has begun .  instead of being told in a linear mode , shine jumps around in time , ala " pulp fiction " .  this narrative device works well ; we see david as a boy , teenager in london and mental-patient in various snippets .  the film then neatly loops back for its uplifting conclusion .  adult-helfgott's return to the light is told in linear fashion .  the lead role is played by 3 different actors , with the teenage-david ( taylor ) and adult-david ( rush ) standing out .  whilst rush is known for his tv work in australia , i think this is his first major cinema work .  his david , whilst clearly damaged - he keeps quoting his " daddy " in a babbling word torrent , cuddles strangers and grabs women on the breasts - is both touching and funny .  taylor's teenage-david is the more sympathy producing role .  we are mute witness to his gradual breakdown as the pressures just keep on building .  his father wants him to play the very demanding rachmaninov's 3rd , whilst his teacher wants to start him with a simple mozart .  technically this is a beautiful film and a lot of thought has gone in to the production .  i particularly like the use of slow motion and sound effects .  one scene has adult-helfgott happily babbling in a car in the rain .  the sound of the windshield wipers fades up over his voice .  with a clever subtlety , the wiper sound appears to morph into a rhythmic thumping , but of the same beat .  the image dissolves and we realise the thumping is the slow motion applause of a crowd .  but it's us being clapped .  we are young-david walking up to the stage for our first public show .  the music , as you would expect from a film of this subject matter , is critical .  and it works very well .  the 'miming' of the actors piano playing is faultless ( apparently rush didn't mime ; he really did play )  helfgott's life is certainly not without it's sympathetic people .  indeed his return to the 'normal' world is accelerated by his chance meetings with two very special women .  his ultimately uplifting story is a magic piece of theatre craft .  it shows that with the 'help of god' we can all find our way back home .  
jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities , but whom you end up liking anyway .  in as good as it gets , the character in question is melvin udall , a successful novelist with obsessive-compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible , except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you-know-where .  he's mean .  i mean really mean .  the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium .  every day , melvin eats at the same cafe , sits at the same table , and gets served by the same waitress .  you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance , when his waitress carol ( helen hunt ) tells him he can just go sit in another section , and all the other waitresses just cringe .  one day , melvin makes a comment that goes to far , and carol , genuinely hurt , comes down on him like a ton of bricks .  at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course , but is also the only person who can get to him , too .  another person who often crosses melvin's sights is simon ( greg kinnear ) , an artist who lives on melvin's floor .  aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city , simon has the added benefit of being gay , making him a prime target .  simon's friend frank ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , also gay , does not fare much better .  when simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment , he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital , and frank , who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor , intimidates melvin into watching after simon's dog while he convalesces .  this is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage .  an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in : melvin gets to like the dog , and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin's softening up to the world around him .  it doesn't happen overnight , but throughout the film , he bites his tongue here , cares a little there , and most miraculously , falls in love .  one of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others .  he's traveling terra incognita here , and it shows .  good performances are turned in by all principal players in this film , especially by nicholson and hunt .  they play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen .  greg kinnear , who is becoming known for his supporting film roles , is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon .  he gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist , and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels .  cuba gooding jr . performs with a hyped-up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear , and comes through with a near constant comic performance .  the screenplay , by mark andrus and james l . brooks , is clever , touching , and funny .  the best part about it , however , is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting .  melvin is a man we can't quite figure out , but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention .  carol is a working woman living with her mother , trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem .  simon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers , but who is still not accepted by much of society .  combined with the talent of the actors , these characters make the film .  the one noticeable area where the film is lacking , however , is the absence of cuba gooding , jr . through the second half .  his character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary , but the film ends before his return , leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved .  i would have liked to have seen more of his character in general , in addition to a part in the film's conclusion .  there's one actor , who will probably not be recognized by any awards , but who contributes greatly to many of the movie's best scenes and who deserves mention .  this is that little dog .  he plays such a pivotal role to melvin's character development , actually serves to forward the plot , and has some absolutely scene-stealing moments , that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal .  award or no , however , when even the dog puts in a good performance , you know you've got an outstanding movie .  
plot : this movie takes place over one day .  it's a rookie cop's narcotics training alongside a seasoned police veteran .  the rookie doesn't know much about " street justice " , so the older cop teaches him about the way things work in the " real world " .  how even cops like themselves have to " bend the rules " and " break the law " every now and then , in order to catch the really bad guys .  critique : a pretty intense little movie with solid acting across the board , some ups , some downs and a thrilling ending , despite a couple of small flaws .  i really enjoyed this movie because it followed two extreme characters and put them in situations which had me wondering about what i would do if i were in their place .  the film gets right into the " dirty " side of , well . . . the  dirt on the streets , and proceeds to teach the rookie cop ( and us , the audience ) how things really work down there .  of course , we're receiving this lesson from a man who has put away a lot of scum in his time , but the things he seems to be doing aren't exactly on the up-and-up either .  and therein , lies the fun of the film .  do you agree that you yourself would need to break a few small laws in order to put away the people who break the really big ones ?  well , as the film moves along , we're given two points of view in respect to this predicament , and to me , both sides made sense at some point or another .  and you gotta give a lot of credit to the screenplay for that , the director , who builds the film up wonderfully ( with the darkness of the day leading to the darkness in the script ) and the two actors who deliver their parts in spades .  hawke , first off , because he rarely plays these " commercial " roles but does so perfectly here , with a vulnerable side which has you feeling for the bastard right off the top .  and denzel , well , what can you say about mr . washington that hasn't already been said before ?  he comes through as per his usual high-level style here , and gives the audience a completely different side to his talent , of which , i personally would like to see more .  he's nice , he's not so nice , he's smart , he's not so smart , he's caring and he's a dog all the way .  the few problems that i did have with this film included the redundant nature of the whole thing at some point ( okay , we get it . . . you  have to be nasty in order to deal with these nasty people . . . move on ) and this one really major " coincidence " which involved a bathtub , that saved the day for one character , but seemed a little too " convenient " for my taste .  i also never really understood how washington's character got out of a certain dire predicament , only to be seen driving his car in the very next scene .  but obviously these small flaws didn't taint my overall enjoyment of this tense drama , a film that gets you right into the streets , into the nooks and the crannies , and into the moral dilemma which lies between the justice system and the day-to-day drug busts .  see it if you want to wrestle with some of these issues yourself , see it if you want to see denzel and ethan strike up a palpable chemistry on-screen , and see it if you like holding on to your seat-handles real tight during a movie .  in fact , see it for the scene in which ethan hawke plays cards with a host of gang-bangers alone . . . dang , now that's intense !  where's joblo coming from ?  the corruptor ( 7/10 ) - crimson tide ( 9/10 ) - l . a . confidential ( /10 ) - lethal weapon ( 8/10 ) - requiem for a dream ( 8/10 ) - seven ( 10/10 ) - shaft ( 7/10 ) - traffic ( 8/10 )  
warning : if you actually wish to see the film , stop reading this and see it .  while i don't blow any plot details , the more you know about a movie , the more disappointing and built up it becomes ( waiting a month to see titanic did the same thing ) .  but , in a nutshell , it's a good film .  star wars episode i : the phantom menace reviewed by vince yim  never having been the biggest star wars fanatic in the world ( i was more into star trek : the next generation ) , it is difficult to relate to the mass fandom surrounding the latest installment , the phantom menace .  however , it can't be ignored .  endless toys lining the shelves , endless news reports , and a multi-billion dollar advertising campaign makes it all the more difficult .  with the level of this hype , one would recall an overhyped disaster from 1998 , godzilla , which definitely failed to live up to expectations .  thankfully , the phantom menace does much , much better .  while the " first " star wars trilogy told the story of jedi knight luke skywalker , the prequels backpedal to tell the back-story of obi wan kenobi and a young jedi named anakin skywalker ( who would become the father of luke and eventually become darth vader ) .  without blowing too much of the story , the phantom menace evolves around a peaceful planet naboo , which is being held hostage by a greedy trade federation , and it's up to two jedi knights ( qui-gon ji , played by liam neeson and obi-wan kenobi , played by ewan mcgreggor ) to free it .  the phantom menace has taken a literal beating from various film critics , leaving me to lower my expectations somewhat .  common complaints range from lack of characterization , weak narrative , poor direction of actors , the dated style , and too much focus over special effects .  still , film critics often apply much historical theory in regards to film criticism , much of which the average film buff does not care for .  hence , this film is a lot of fun and definitely an improvement over the previous films ( even with the " improvements " in the special editions ) .  there are many memorable sequences throughout the film , ranging from the fast and furious " pod race " sequence ( which is a take on the chariot races in " ben hur " ) and the many fight scenes involving legions of battle droids .  utilizing technology that is light years beyond anything made before , special effects and computers are used to create everything from monsters to robots to amazing cityscapes with incredible detail .  no matter how many times you watch this film , you will catch something new .  the level of humour is a bit higher than the previous films as well , mostly conveyed through the reluctant hero jar jar binks , who belongs to a race known as the gungans .  best described as an mr . bean from the planet naboo , he steals the show .  unfortunately , being that he is a computer-generated character , tells a bit about the direction of the actors ( although natalie portman as the queen is pretty effective , as is jake lloyd as the young anakin skywalker ) .  with star wars mania at an all time high , there is the risk that the film will disappoint ( i myself had my doubts ) , which this film does have a tendency to do at times .  there are a few logic problems with the plot , several things are left unchecked , and at times seems to be made only for diehard star wars fans ( although the appearance of the tusken raiders makes for more than a few laughs ) .  that , and young anakin skywalker is a really annoying character , coming off as a smarmy , arrogant brat ( with such an attitude , it's no wonder why he turns to the dark side ) .  still , it seems that many people , especially critics , are missing the point .  the film is some of the most fun 2 and a half hours that you'll blow in your life , which is something i wouldn't mind doing again .  while it may not have the psychological impact of an academy award contender , who really cares ?  the film is pure fun from beginning to end .  and isn't that what really matters ?  
steven spielberg's " amistad , " which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship , then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who " owned " them , is concerned with several different aspects of this story .  first , the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery .  second , it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case , including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) .  last , and most importantly , it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade .   " amistad " succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements .  i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another " anti-slavery " movie .  having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery , i doubted that there was much i didn't already know about it .  fortunately , i turned out to be wrong .  for one thing , spielberg's camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders' operations in africa , so " amistad " was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning .  and some of the images here are , in fact , much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery .  one scene in the middle , in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their " excess " slaves by throwing them overboard to drown , has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year .  spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would , and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc-17 rating .  the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians , such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain , whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time .  exposing politicians as narrow-minded , opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff , of course , but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation .  the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time , such that john quincy adams ( and probably other politicians like him ) , who clearly disapproved of the practice , was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court .  the biggest success of " amistad " is probably the characterization of cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , the lawyer who represents them in court .  through cinque , we are given a window into the native culture , as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member , or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ .  cinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that , again , contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles .   " what kind of country is this , where laws 'almost' work ? " he asks baldwin in bewilderment , when he learns that the case must be re-tried before the supreme court .  spielberg's direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times , such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque's angry outburst in the court room .  still , there isn't enough of this for it to be a serious problem .  the main flaw in this film , which prevents it from earning four stars , is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can't quite handle all of these issues at the same time , so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie .  this summer's contact , for example , dealt with several issues at once , but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and , most importantly , all of them were resolved at once .   " amistad " tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams , but it somehow feels a little forced , and in any case the speech itself , which lasts almost fifteen minutes , wears out its welcome about halfway through .  perhaps the best way to describe it is this : " amistad " is three four star films edited into one .  almost every individual scene works , but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence , and thus is less than the sum of its parts .  however , i can't honestly say how it could have been done differently , and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film , and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery .  
a common complaint amongst film critics is " why aren't there more literate scripts available ? "  quiz show gives signs of hope that the art of writing isn't dead in hollywood and that we need not only look to independent films for thoughtful content .  paul attanasio's script takes what could have been a tepid thriller ( the quiz show scandals of the late 50s ) and delivers a telling parable about the emptiness of the post war american dream and the golden bubble that surrounds and protects tv networks and their sponsors .  the film is riddled with telling symbols ( e . g .  a '58 chrysler , a radio announcement of sputnik ) but is never heavy handed .  deft direction by robert redford and keen performances by ralph fiennes , john turturro and rob morrow dovetail perfectly with the carefully honed script .  redford departs from the usually overlight , " cable tv quality " sets and camera work so common in recent 20th century period pieces .  quiz show perfectly captures the colors and textures of the eisenhower years .  although i was only 4 years old when the " twenty one " scandal broke , enough of the 50s icons survived throughout my childhood for me to recognize the authenticity of redford's almost tangible palette .  from plastic covered furniture to carefully coifed contestants , the images ring true from that era of rampant consumerism , of a generation that had gone through 15 years of depression and world war without " disposable income , " before the manifestation of its american dream .  the film deftly weaves several themes together , from assimilation and exclusion of jews from " the good life , " to the lengths that a scion of a literary family will go to to match his father's fame .  though the 50s audience that is " rocked " by this scandal may initially seem naive to us , they should appear all too familiar , with our current national passion for the rise and fall of icons like michael jackson or tonya harding .  charles van doren and herbie stemple were the overnight mega celebrities of their day .  the tv audience is almost a fourth main character , always at the center of the decisions being made on their behalf .  at the film's end , the credits roll past slow motion footage of that same 50s tv audience , mindlessly laughing at some piece of fluff .  like the distorted mirror that captured a blurred swastika at the end of cabaret , this " mirror " may reflect an image we're not all that comfortable with .  
it's wednesday , march 27 , and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte , south carolina .  the crime : a young prostitute , elizabeth ( renee zellweger ) , has been brutally slain .  one half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station .  the other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority , miles away .  the police duo of braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are strapped for leads .  at the moment , they have only one possible suspect : wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy , unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act .  that's the premise for deceiver , a new thriller from the pate brothers , jonas and josh , who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave .  deceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not- so-bright cops ( captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland's iq is 151 ; by contrast , kennesaw's is 122 and braxton's is 102 ) .  the setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered .  over three days , as wayland returns to answer more questions , the drama and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until , inevitably , it boils over .  other plot elements are thrown in for good measure .  wayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can , in stressful situations , render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent .  braxton , a compulsive gambler , is deep in debt to a local syndicate .  and kennesaw is haunted by a dark , abusive side that delights in terrorizing women , especially his wife ( rosanna arquette ) , whom he suspects of being unfaithful .  the foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeth's death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand : the suspect or his questioners .  deceiver , which mostly transpires in a dimly-lit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue , has the feel of a david mamet play : edgy , claustrophobic , and tense .  the atmosphere is explosive , and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting .  deceiver has the power to grab an audience .  unfortunately , in the end , it succumbs to the need to throw in one last , unexpected twist , and this is its undoing .  for , while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers , it also stretches our credulity too much , and raises more questions than it answers .  it's only an effective wrap-up if you don't think too carefully about its full implications .  of course , the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic .  police procedure is totally ignored and it's almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner .  but the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction , not plot details .  deceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station , and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute .  the pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth's final days and hours .  the most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice-over by visually showing what really happened .  moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks .  the movie , obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir , drips atmosphere .  there are some fascinating stylistic touches ; for example , although the setting is contemporary , all of the telephones are old-fashioned , rotary models .  cinematographer bill butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver's look .  some of the things he tries ( mostly those that involve the contrast between light and shadow ) work exceptionally well , while others ( like any of several lazy susan shots ) seem more like unnecessary visual tricks .  as wayland , tim roth gives the film's top performance , despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting .  roth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as he's supposed to be .  the other two leads , chris penn and michael rooker , aren't as effective .  both play their characters like familiar types .  penn's performance is uninspired ; rooker's lacks subtlety .  some of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors .  renee zellweger , in a role that's miles away from her star-making turn in jerry maguire , brings a note of vulnerability and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature .  rosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw's wife , and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who's entrusted with evaluating wayland's condition .  one of the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down to the audience .  plot points aren't hammered home , and , although the ending has its weaknesses , everything isn't spelled out in bold letters .  the pates give audience members credit for having brains , which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers .  occasionally gripping and never uninteresting , deceiver is a fine noir effort .  
 " through a spyglass , i could see everything . "  king louis xvi was beheaded on january 21 , 1793 , but instead of visualizing this act of regicide , legendary auteur eric rohmer's the lady and the duke observes from afar .  consider it a view to a kill made abstract .  a proper british ( yes , british ) gentlewoman , grace elliott ( lucy russell ) , and her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in meudon at the glistening city of paris , where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants .  the maid narrates what little she sees of the execution through her telescope ( often muttering , " i don't know , " ) as the sound of cheering patriots and revolutionaries echoes through the air .  what we don't see might not be able to hurt us .  just close your eyes and think of england .  during times of revolution , the aristocracy may feel a false sense of calm in their parlor halls , discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until the walls cave in on them .  adapted from elliott's memoirs , journal of my life during the french revolution , rohmer's latest artistic tour-de-force may seem far removed from his domestic comedies ( tales of the four seasons , etc . ) , a period film set during the most violent changes in french history .  resisting the temptation for grand-scale theatrics , much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes .  grace elliott makes for an unlikely protagonist : a headstrong , snobbish blueblood , one unprepared for the machinations of history that sweep her along .  a foreigner who accepts the french king as her own , grace's life seems defined by fancy attire and lively political debate with her former lover , the king's hot-blooded cousin , prince philipe , duke of orleans ( jean-claude dreyfus ) .  the times are changing , though , and the gears inch ever closer toward violence .  during the september massacres of 1792 , she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the head of the duke's sister-in-law on a stake .  rohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil , old fashioned , almost stagy parlor scenes to the swell of an angry mob .  in doing so , he achieves what braveheart and the patriot could not : the face of death .  when grace sees her friend's disembodied head on a pole , rohmer's attention drifts from the societal change to one woman's reaction shot , laden with hot tears .  grace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice , sheltering him from the mob .  through her relationship with the duke , she seeks a passport for this one activist's escape .  grace doesn't even understand her own actions ( and the duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger ) .  she endures persecution from robespierre and his gang of thuggish equalizers , ceaseless police monitoring , house searches , even a brief imprisonment for harmless international correspondence .  maintaining her stiff upper lip and pampered life ( her imperious attitude to the servants never changes ) , she becomes a heroine through circumstance .  the events themselves are intrusions upon her person , her home , and therefore her values .  aristocracy proves a glass house , one that can barely withstand the upheaval of stones .  the duke is called to vote on the king's punishment , and despite his hours of deliberation with friends and advisors , talk means nothing in the face of bloody action ( or futile inaction ) .  the episodic structure creates a wobbly , jarring detachment from the events of the french revolution , which serves as metaphor but also disconnects potential audience identification .  lazy viewers ( and critics ) may also complain that knowledge of french history is required for enjoyment of the lady and the duke .  that's foolery , but brings up the valid criticism that rohmer's characters occasionally become didactic .  rohmer's imperfect but assured push toward the future remains staunch and notable for casting a cautious eye upon the past while taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future .  what may arouse interest in the lady and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary and historical passions is rohmer's use of cutting edge digital technology as a means of exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanism .  the actors were filmed against a bluescreen , then placed against painted backdrops recreating the vastness of 18th century paris .  this recreation calls attention to itself in every shot , a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings and wide-open streets .  it looks as phony as titanic , but unlike james cameron's debacle , the lady and the duke plays with the notion of false security in those walls of stone .  why ?  they aren't real .  the very foundation rohmer's characters stand upon is false , and in their groundlessness they must discover themselves , in all their insubstantial glory .  screened at the 2001 new york film festival ( feature coming soon ) .  
'pleasantville' ( 1998 ) taps into hollywood's lack of integrity with subtle messages that can be easily missed   ( www . pleasantville . com ) april 2 , 1999 ( friday )  cast : tobey maguire , reese witherspoon , william h . macy , joan allen , j . t .  walsh , jeff daniels  mpaa rating : pg-13 for sexual content and thematic elements  genre : drama  in my opinion :  in short : it takes a lot of careful observation to see the true morals and lessons brought out in this film ; one can easily be misled as to what the real message is .  review : in a literally colorless world with an almost mechanical population , there is no room for transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life , such as rain , fire , or emotions .  the town of pleasantville has one adjective : pleasant .  there is no sadness , no fear , no danger , no discomfort , no love , and no hate .  put simply , it's a place alanis morissette could really work wonders for .  j one big note however is that it is only a 50's sitcom that airs in reruns on an " oldies " tv station ? or is it ?  i had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed .  i found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back 3 more times in the period it endured at the box office .  but it wasn't until months later , when i slipped in for a small showing in one of those crummy " dollar theaters " after not having seen it for so long , that my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning and perspective than i had previously experienced .  it is a far too feasible misconception that this is a film which forwards the idea that a world without some " healthy " immorality is not a world at all .  instead , the actual message , which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that i know of , is that a world without immorality doesn't give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself , because everything is automatically right .  there is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made , no space for growth , and never anything new to learn , and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story .  now i'm not saying that's necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted , but that is hands down the proper way in which it should be .  besides a hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews , this film has elements of physical wonder and strength that make it just so great to watch .  the visual effects are indeed striking and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable .  after spending the bulk of the movie staring at black and white , it's hard not to identify and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance and more .  a truly intelligent addition to it all , however , is the charming and ardently attainable cast that operates together like clockwork .  that said , the plot goes as such .  david and jennifer are two very 90's high school twins with the typical " relationship " outline of don't-mess-with-my-life-and-i-won't-mess-with-yours .  they demonstrate the well-known teenage qualities of two of the common versions of adolescents today .  david is the shyer , subtler twin who would rather watch tv land than mtv , while jennifer is the wild , licentious one who spends her days at the mall and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world of degradation .  but when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two of the main characters , they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home .  nevertheless , jennifer works her magic and introduces the town to a more unrestrained approach to life , and while david frantically tries to stop her and get them back home , he realizes that change was exactly what the town needed .  and , as said earlier , not to flip the town around into some corrupt society , but rather to give people the choice to decide between good and bad and to reap the results of their decisions and learn from them .  not only were difficult choices being brought upon the town , but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place .  people got hurt .  they cried .  they became afraid and happy and thoughtful and started to think for themselves , and that's when their physical world turned colors as well .  this can be looked upon as quite a controversial movie , but to me the message is finally clear .  i hope after reading this people can be more open to the film than they had been in the past , and realize that without choosing how our own lives will be run , we'll never know what we could have done better .  until the next great movie i see , i remain sincerely , danielle flynn , imr  
for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and " high art , " the son's room is an inventive , subtle alternative .  written by , directed , and starring nanni moretti , it takes us through the slow , complicated path of bereavement .  slow is the best description for the film at first .  it takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal , happy family .  father and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities .  they laugh , spend free time together , and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder .  you get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome .  but suddenly , the son is found to be dead after a diving accident .  the family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it , but can also be trying on the attention span .  though the film drags and even repeats itself , this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving .  though nanni moretti wore several hats for this production , it doesn't come across as a vanity piece .  one might wish he hadn't picked the profession of analyst for the father , giovanni ( which he stars as ) , if only because this makes his character's reactions so predictable .  what saves it is a well written script , with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction .  the potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative , or that remind a depressed person of loss .  you start to take notice of the cracked dishes , ignored when familial bliss was in full swing .  you remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block , and not necessarily huge events like graduation .  even better are the role reversals that take place within the household .  while giovanni and paola ( laura morante ) do check up on their daughter irene ( jasmine trinca ) , there is a sense of being on autopilot .  not only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more , she'll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them .  these scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms , frequently crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic , unexpected change .  respectfully , gender issues never enter the picture .  self-propelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing , so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family .  though giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at a party with friends , there is never a sense that he or she is more stoic , or more correct in the search to restore a sense of a balance to their lives .  most films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama , speeches , and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing .  in contrast , the son's room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning ( denial , depression , anger , bargaining , acceptance ) through each of its main characters .  it's not the most engaging 100 minutes , but it is certainly easy to relate to .  
elizabeth is a potent historical drama set in england in the mid-1500s .  it is a time when stately royal ceremonies are as commonplace as public burnings .  internally , the catholics wage war against the protestants .  meanwhile , spain , scotland and france strategize their next moves in the struggle for power .  little does england know that a young woman named elizabeth ( cate blanchett ) will be their greatest hope for survival .  the film charts elizabeth's tumultuous struggle to gain true power over her kingdom .  as a protestant , she is the last person any of the catholic royalty would want to be queen .  but her half-sister queen mary ( kathy burke ) , deathly ill and unable to conceive a child , pleas with elizabeth to take over the throne .  mary gives her her blessing on only one condition : that elizabeth renounce her faith and uphold the teachings of catholicism across the land .  once declared queen , elizabeth immediately finds herself under assault , both by her own subjects ( including the duke of norfolk , played with steely-eyed grace by christopher eccleston ) and by forces abroad .  slowly but surely , the neophyte ruler takes england by its reigns and forges a new path for her kingdom .  elizabeth is surrounded by a keenly drawn cadre of subjects and advisers .  her closest ally is the mysterious sir francis walsingham ( geoffrey rush , in a perfectly subtle performance ) .  also on her side is sir william cecil ( sir richard attenborough ) , her well-meaning but misguided chief adviser .  with few people she can trust , elizabeth must prove her self-worth any way she can , even if it means being the iron-fisted ruler she secretly despises .  blanchett deserves an oscar for her performance as elizabeth .  she portrays the young queen with just the right balance of gawky self-consciousness and shrewd charisma .  though not a classical beauty , blanchett is able to entrance the viewer with just a coy smile or an impish smirk .  she is at home with her character's playful tendencies , particularly in one scene where elizabeth dances unabashedly with childhood friend and lover lord robert dudley ( joseph fiennes ) .  whether fending off unctuous suitors or " playing " the houses in court , blanchett's elizabeth radiates a confidence which impossible to dislike .  almost as interesting as the character of elizabeth are shekhar kapur's visual delights .  he and cinematographer remi adefarasin have crafted a film with a rich color palette that is a feast for the eyes .  rolling green hills , extravagant ceremonial galas , dark and foreboding corridors -- all are depicted with a real sense of artistic appreciation .  the castles and cathedrals of europe have rarely been doted on so lovingly as they are here .  though writer michael hirst's script gets a little murky at times , and his injections of humor get a little overplayed , elizabeth pulses with the right amount of dramatic and cinematic verve to make it just deserving of a theatrical viewing .  as a whole , the story survives because elizabeth's struggle is one which deserves attention .  by the time she makes her shocking ( but very sensible ) final declaration , we're ready to bow to elizabeth as our own queen .  
the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year .  we are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics , loved by the people , and make tons of money at the box office .  this year , the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic , the mummy .  i have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies , and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them .  that tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza .  in the mummy , the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o'connell .  he teams up with a curious , clumsy librarian named evelyn , played by rachel weisz , to find the mysterious city of the dead , hamunaptra .  evelyn loves egypt , and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable .  rick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle , and that's why she chose him to lead her there .  also tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn's brother , jonathan , played by john hannah ( sliding doors ) .  now in hamunaptra , the three uncover " the book of the dead . "  the curious evelyn unlocks the book , reads from it , and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep ( arnold vosloo ) becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book .  along with imhotep arising from the dead , the ten curses of egypt become in full effect , launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra .  not only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him , he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt .  don't expect huge things out of the mummy , but just expect to have a good time .  this movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects , which may turn off some viewers .  on the other hand , this type of film is one of my favorites , but that's up to you to decide .  there is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though .  the state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world .  we are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert , swarms of beetles and locusts , and even creatures crawling under a human's skin .  these may have been in other movies before , but not like in the mummy .  as of now , the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year , but all this could change when star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country .  in the past , brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles .  when playing " george " in disney's george of the jungle , he was mainly not known by anyone .  i would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him a name , and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens .  in the mummy , fraser gets to play an action hero , and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role , as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle .  although brendan fraser is great , rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast .  weisz really reminded me of a character from an old , horror film .  the way she acts , looked , and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time .  evelyn is probably the only character that was likable , considering that the other characters , like john hannah's , didn't get much personal attention .  in many films , when different genres are mixed , the mixing usually works , and i like it for the most part .  in the mummy though , not all of the mixing works .  there are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror , some with potential comedy , some with potential drama , and some with potential pure action , but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work .  the mummy could have gotten an " a " rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these .  i didn't mind the corny one-liners here and there during action sequences , but it certainly could have done without them .  the cinematography is amazing in the mummy .  particularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt , we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt , mummies , and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians .  the costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography .  from ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits , the costumes are always top notch .  the bottom line- with the mummy , the summer is off to its usually great start .  
usually when a blockbuster comes out , it's loaded with effects , stars , bad scripts , and plenty of action .  mystery men may contain an all-star cast , and efects , but the clever script and characters are what really works , which is rare to see this year .  the film is based upon the comic book series " the flaming carrot " by bob burden , in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime , only to be out done by the real hero of champion city , captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) .  things go a little haywire , when the sinister casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) is released into the city , where he captures captain amazing , and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city .  well , the trio decide to take matters in their own hands , by saving the city , but first they need some assitance .  this is where the film takes a turn for the better .  in the beggining , there were only 3 wanna be heroes .   " blue raja ( hank azaria ) , " mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and " the shoveller ( william h . macy ) .  sure they were enterataining , but their acts grew old fast .  that is until they aquire " invisible boy " ( kel mitchell ) , and " the bowler " ( janeane garafalo ) and " mr . splein " ( paul reubens ) , 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess .  thankfully , the original 3 heroes become amusing , with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen .  the whole premise is rather ridiculous , but packs a few punches to keep interest .  for one , the film is considerably clever .  it literally pokes fun at super hero films , like batman and robin , superman etc . in fact , many scenes are similar to batman and robin , including the opening sequence , only altered in a humorous and superior way .  a part of the cleverness comes from the cast .  sometimes a film with such talent is overblown , but the acting is what keeps it alive here .  while azaria and macy were enteratining , 2 characters really stood out .  one was paul reuben .  no matter how disgusting or revolting " mr . splein " may be , you still can't help but laugh .  it' so incredibly moronic , it's just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions .  janeane garafalo also was an interesting character .  she seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem , due to her enthusiasm , that kept the film flowing .  men is worth seeing alone , for those 2 troubled heroes .  on the downside , a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off .  kel mitchell and geoffrey rush , were both utterly useless .  their parts were so limited , they'd be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20 minutes .  ben stiller too was wasted , mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue .  none of these characters get a rise out of anybody , but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film .  as far as the budget goes , it was wisely spent on the cast , not the effects .  while the set designs and action all look nice , i'm glad there was a seperate aspect , that the film focused on , and for that i applaud .  slow at times , and rather pointless , mystery men still delivers .  it forgets about money making , because it's not likely to make a bundle like it's proceeders , and that's what works .  stupid ?  maybe , but for once i'm not disappointed .  no one expected an intelligent film , but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year .  
in october of 1997 , audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer .  the film went on to gross over 70 million dollars in the u . s . , and even developed a cult following , much like the previous year's 100 million dollar grossing scream .  when the trailer hit theaters in september attached to urban legend , it looked like a wonderful follow-up .  did it live up to the first film ?  the answer is no .  jennifer love hewitt returns as julie james , a survivor of the serial killer that attempted to kill her and her friends a year before .  she has been so upset since the incident .  nightmares haunt her all over the place , but she has to move on .  she know attends college , and is best friends with a funny , outgoing girl named karla ( brandy ) , who is trying to hook julie up with will benson , played by newcomer matthew settle .  karla's boyfriend is tyrell , the funny , outgoing type , who is played by soul food's mekhi phifer .  freddie prinze jr . also returns as ray , julie's boyfriend from a year ago .  one morning , julie and karla are called up by a local radio station who are offering four tickets to the bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil .  of course , they answer it correctly , and they are off to the bahamas .  julie wants ray to come , but he declines the offer , so karla secretly invites will instead to help boost her plan of hooking him up with julie .  after they arrive at their hotel , it is just them and the staff on the island .  it starts off as the weekend of their dreams .  something just had to come to mess up the one care-free weekend of julie's life though .  ben willis ( muse watson ) is back , and he isn't letting anyone survive this time .  will ray come to the rescue before he can kill them off one by one ?  jennifer love hewitt and brandy turn in respectable performances .  brandy in particular was impressive , considering this is her first feature film .  you could see that the characters were horrified , and they would do anything possible to survive .  matthew settle and freddie prinze jr . are a completely different story .  let's start with settle .  matthew is completely fake in this film .  you could not believe a word coming out of his mouth .  you could tell he was acting , and its reasons like him that this one isn't as good as the first one .  he does do a good job towards the end , but that doesn't clear up the scars he already left on the film .  freddie prinze jr . is almost as bad as matthew settle was .  he is almost completely unbelievable , and the majority of his lines are completely meaningless and out of place .  we don't see him as much as settle , otherwise he could have done just as much damage as settle did .  mekhi phifer is alright as tyrell , but yet again the dialogue is out of place .  the plot of i still know turns out to be a pretty good one at the end of the movie .  i like where the filmmakers went with this second installment , but maybe if it occurred in the same town as the first one , it would have been a bit better .  the cinematography and setting of their island are simply wonderful .  there are a lot of very nice shots around their hotel .  the sound is pretty good , but still not as creepy as the first film's .  jennifer love hewitt's song , " how do i deal " is also played for about thirty seconds .  i still know what you did last summer is nothing compared to the first film .  the first film was very suspenseful , and it contained some very memorable scenes .  the last fifteen minutes of i still know what you did last summer really picked up , and almost reached the same level as the first film .  before this part in the film , there are many unnecessary deaths and fake scares .  that is okay though , because the film is still very much fun and there are a few suspenseful scenes .  i think the reason this film wasn't as scary as the original was because in the first one , the killer terrorized the people involved in the incident .  he made them suffer for what they did .  in the second film , ben willis just kills anyone he feels like .  he doesn't stick with ray and julie , who were the ones he is actually after .  he had to go after karla , will , and tyrell .  if the characters he stalked were in some relation to the incident that went on when he was ran over by julie , ray , helen , and barry , it could have been much better , and it would have made a lot more sense .  the bottom line- not a disappointment , but a third in the series would be out of hand .  
this film is based on the campy tv show from the 1960's under the same appellation .  mind you , most people ( including yours truly ) who will see this movie will not have seen any episodes from the original series .  the movie is really a stand alone in that regard .  the family robinson . . . lost in space .  plot : set in the year 2058 , the family robinson is chosen to sail out into space in search of other planets that might contain the natural resources earth needs in order to survive its future .  a colonization process , if you will .  they are joined by able pilot west ( leblanc ) , and evil uninvited stowaway ( oldman ) , who does not want to see the trip conclude on a successful tip .  eventually , their trek goes awry , and all are " lost in space " .   " how do get back to earth ? "  is the question that infests the rest of this sci-fi epic .  critique : this film reminded me a lot of the fifth element ( 6 . 5/10 ) from the summer of 1997 .  it's a film with a lot of flash , but very little actual substance .  admittedly , there isn't an annoying character like chris tucker from the other film , but this film does run a little too long , and did lose me in regards to its complex time-travel / multi-dimensional story line .  having said that , the special effects in this movie were amazing , and the overall look and feel were also way above average .  you really felt like you were in the future , and riding through space with these poor souls .  unfortunately for this chosen family , their 10-year old son is the smartest one in the group , and the father is too wrapped up in his work to notice the rest of his family ( ever heard that one before ?  yawn ! ) .  the acting is ok , and i was especially surprised at the solid performance by tv friend's matt leblanc who shows us all that he's definitely more than just a pretty face .  on the down side , the family riff-raff that cuts through most of the picture is lame and time-consuming ( even though we gotta give them credit for " trying " to develop characters in a sci-fi pic ) , the story line is hard to follow , the evil character in the movie actually tells people that he's " evil " , and the movie goes on for about 20 minutes too long .  on the slick side , many of the special effects are really cool ( the sequence in which the family is " paralyzed " during the hyper-drive is awesome , and the animated monkey that joins the family halfway through the flic is mucho cool ) , the credit presentation at the end of the film is slamming , and the adventures that they fall into are somewhat thrilling ( i will also admit that " somehow " they got me to semi-tear up near the conclusion of this picture . . . . very  odd . . . . . ) .  overall , if you're a big sci-fi fan , check this movie out for the special effects and challenging narrative , and if you're not , i would still suggest seeing this movie , but then you could probably wait until it comes out on video so that you forward past some of the boring parts .  little known facts : this film will always be remembered as the movie that knocked titanic ( 7/10 ) out of the top spot at the box-office after 15 straight weeks at number one .  garry oldman is british , and was once married to uma thurman for about six months .  mimi rogers was tom cruise's first wife .  
richard gere can be a commanding actor , but he's not always in great films .  everything comes together here .  gere is a big time chicago defense attorney who takes on a seemingly unwinable case in hopes of even more publicity .  it doesn't go exactly as he expects .  gere's client , aaron ( edward norton ) , is a shy stuttering tennessee boy who is accused of brutally murdering and mutilating a catholic archbishop .  the evidence is stacked against him .  he was caught running from the scene covered in the bishop's blood .  his bloody footprints are all over the murder scene .  he has a relationship with the priest .  gere talks to the boy , believes that he is actually innocent and sets about finding the real killer .  despite the lawyer's proclamations that he doesn't care about the guilt of his clients and that the real thrill is gambling with people's lives , he becomes involved with aaron and is determined to free him .  lots of complications and twists .  the prosecuting attorney is gere's former co-worker and lover .  they both work each other's motives to their legal advantages and it gets messy .  her boss had major economic dealings with the archbishop that went sour and seems to have crime connections .  aaron gets weirder and weirder as the trial goes on .  gere's case is falling apart and he is faced with about a dozen ethical dilemmas .  gere is exceptional as the well-dressed reserved counselor , but just once , i wanted to see him kick back and come out of his " suit " persona .  even when he loses it , you don't see very far inside .  norton's aaron is convincing : he comes across as the backwoods kid misplaced in the big city .  the supporting cast does a fine job of holding together the story .  as with most of the effective courtroom dramas , the cinematography is crisp and rich .  the story will keep you on the edge of your seat .  nothing is what it seems .  
 ( note : there are spoilers regarding the film's climax ; the election , of course )  we see matthew broderick , a man torn to a primal state ; he's been unfaithful to his wife , lied to and manipulated his students , and by the same token they've demeaned his masculinity , his self-respect , his desperate attempt at changing the world .  and yet , he equates the cause of his pain , his torment , with tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) .  no matter how many students have come and gone , and disappointed him as an educator , she's the real threat .  about to give in , and divulge that she's won by only a lone vote , broderick's mccalister turns in defeat , sees tracy's euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says , 'no' .  the fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men , no matter how obscure , have in their relationships ; a traditional expectation of success , to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry .  she can't go higher than him .  he won't allow it .  and what's amazing about " election " is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor .  early in the film we learn that tracy was romantically , and then sexually , involved with a now departed teacher .  it's like payne and taylor , his co-screenwriter , have taken tracy , a girl desperate for friendship , loyalty , and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers , that they found sitting at the teachers' lunch table more fitting , to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist .  and it's amazing the compassion that we have ; it seems so real to us , and not merely because it's happened before , splashed all over the front pages , but , because of the all around " nice " persona of these people , we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters .  it's with mandy barnett's " if you'll be the teacher " playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most ; a final , viscous injection of bittersweet irony .  sexuality , though , is not the only basis for payne's satire , or its success .  it also makes a telling point about politics , friendship , and class boundaries .  satire is required ( or ought to be , anyway ) to take itself seriously , or act so , while the audience does not .  it's a fine line to straddle , but some films ignore it altogether ( " drop dead gorgeous " leaps infuriatingly to mind ) .  payne and taylor hit the right chord ; their characters are real people : neither is perfect , but rather both of the leads are flawed , misguided individuals who retain , somewhat , noble intentions at heart .  we sympathize with them , but still , as a satire , their idiosyncratic behavior , and their wrongdoing , is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle , but also reflect and meditate , about .  minus half a point , though , for payne admitting not to having seen " ferris bueller's day off " .  whatever .  
director jan de bont certainly knows how to make top quality action films .  you need look no further than die hard ( he was director of photography ) , speed and last years twister for examples of his hi- octane , edge of your seat thrill prowess .  speed 2 is no exception .  this time , the action takes place on a huge cruise liner , on which sandra bullock and jason patrick are trying to develop their relationship .  yep , that's right , no keanu reeves this time , but fear not , jason patrick is more than up to the job .  speaking of which , the job at hand is to stop completely bonkers terrorist , willem dafoe , from crashing the liner into a huge island , after stealing a diamond collection .  the reason for this act of destruction is revenge .  after years of working for the company that builds cruise liner computers , he contracts copper poisoning and is retired .  naturally , what entails next is a lot of running/jumping about and general high quality action as jason patrick does his level best to save the day .  thinking back on this film , you can't help , but admire it's structure .  the way , willem dafoe initiates his plan and throws red herrings to the crew and passengers .  the race against time to save the liner from crashing , and of course , the finale chase scence .   ( although this is ruined by an over the top , one too many stunt and explosion . )  simple in construction , effective in it's execution , and the result , a clear and concise , highly enjoyable action film .  the acting is adequate , although it's darned obvious that sandra bullock is only in it to create a 'hot totty' appeal to the men ( and she does that perfectly ! ) , jason patrick fills the action hero role superbly and willem dafoe is just great as the crazed terrorist .  overall , speed 2 is a most enjoyable thrill ride .  not up to it's predecessor's high calibre but very good all the same .  there is plenty going on , some of the thrills are quite tense and it also proves that you do not need blood and guts to make a good action movie .  
more than forty years ago , the " sword and sandals " genre of historical epic ruled the box office .  during the 1950's hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope .   " ben-hur . "   " cleopatra . "   " the robe . "   " sparticus . "   " the fall of the roman empire . "   " quo vadis . "  sometimes brilliant , sometimes campy , the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood .  since then , epics have appeared infrequently ( " the last emperor , " " braveheart " ) and some of the best have been small-screen affairs produced in the 1970's ( " roots , " " shogun " ) .  yet , the phrase " we who are about to die salute you " has been absent until now .   " gladiator " begins in germania in a . d . 180 .  roman general maximus ( russell crowe ) has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting .  however , the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) will prove a poor successor , so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again .  when commodus hears the plan , he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered .  maximus escapes from the executioners , but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son .  a caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa .   ( why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus' place is never explained . )  an african named juba ( djimon hounsou ) treats maximus' wounds .  proximo ( oliver reed ) , a gladiator who won his freedom , purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena .  of course , maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier , and his fame spreads .  when commodus reopens the coliseum , proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete .  our hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus' sister lucilla ( connie nielsen ) .  the similarities to " braveheart " are obvious : an evil king , a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family , the aid of a lovestruck princess .  also , like mel gibson's epic , " gladiator " has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the hero's anger .  it's a simple tale of good versus evil .  maximus has all the manly virtues : nobility of purpose , courage in battle , loyalty to king and country , physical stamina , and devotion to family .  commodus is his opposite in every way : a sniveling , selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience .  the opening night crowd in my theater was about 70% male , and that seems appropriate .   " gladiator " is a guy movie ( would the opposite of a " chick flick " be a " dick flick " ? ) .  there's much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences .   ( those easily offended by gore should stay away . )  lucilla is the only female character , and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife .  joaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance .  in the scene where commodus kills his father , phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father's love or pride .  throughout the picture , phoenix manages to give depth to a character who's scripted as a caricature of evil .  i've been a russell crowe fan since " romper stomper . "  this role doesn't offer him the complexities of his parts in " l .  a . confidential " and " the insider " -- essentially his job is to grunt heroically -- but his voice , which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp , is perfect for the genre .  the late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role .  i hope it will be rewarded with an oscar .  my only major quibble with " gladiator " is its stylized look .  several scenes are tinted .  we've seen a lot of the tinted look lately , particularly in " payback " and " the matrix . "  i don't get the appeal of the style , which makes feature films look like tv ads .  in " payback " it was merely annoying , but in " gladiator " it bleaches the color out of the grand spectacles that are the raison d'etre of the roman epic .   ( perhaps it's meant to gloss over the imperfections of the computer-generated shots . )  also , the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo and fast forward simultaneously .   ( it reminds me of the way the flash runs in the comic books , leaving a half-blurred trail of images of himself behind . )  with a more realistic look , " gladiator " could be even more satisfying than " braveheart " because it has a tighter script and a more fulfilling conclusion .  bottom line : a rousing action film enriched by fine performances but tarnished by stylistic choices .  
people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies .  often science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller .  in such cases , mistakes are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly marked .  but , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic .  such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman .  the mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits .  but the right stuff film isn't even fiction .  it was based on the non-fiction book by tom wolfe , covering the early years of american space program .  the plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base , major test site for experimental planes .  the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier .  many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado .  but one quiet pilot , chuck eager ( played by sam shaped ) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records .  ten years later , soviets have launched " sputnik " marking the beginning of the space age .  in order to regain national prestige , us government decides to be the first to send man into space .  best air force , navy and marine pilots are recruited into program , but not yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all-american image .  in one of critics' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s .  such high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman's film looks quite atypical for its time .  with more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life .  but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker .  philip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original , memorable movies .  the right stuff was the last of them , swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual , risk-taking " artsy " projects .  the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film .  the plot is almost non-existent and not very coherent ; the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in yeager , to new generation of the astronauts .  the film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece .  that gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles .  sam shepard is great as yeager , war hero whose greatest achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty .  on the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases .  shepard's performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean-cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn .  young dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom , superbly played by fred ward .  always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard .  kaufman left room for female talents to excel too - barbara hershey , pamela reed , veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots' wives .  royal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher , but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice-president lyndon b . johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch .  great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman's superb direction .  most notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time .  the beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert , as virtual unknowns , far away from strict rules and discipline .  everything seems natural -yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world .  in that setting , it's quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights .  but the times are changing ; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war , and " natural " pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined , conventional pilots .  their entire lives become focus of media frenzy , and their job is subjected to strict rules , meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats , publicity-seeking politicians and uncaring scientists ( like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun , played by scott beach ) only to preserve their most basic human dignity .  this contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence - while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity , " mercury " astronauts receive fame and fortune , although some of them even before going in the space .  those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman's superb use of poetic movie language .  editing is great , and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion ( the same image would be copied in many latter films ) .  although kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military , which provided authentic locations and period equipment , he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights .  those effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space .  another fine contribution of this film is " oscar " -awarded musical score by bill conti ; i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it .  it is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy .  some of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period .  this film is great , and its cult status is well deserved , but there are some minor flaws .  some of the " mercury " astronauts aren't fleshed out enough ( although being played by fine actors , like lance henriksen ) .  film also lacks proper closure .  on the other hand , most logical conclusion of the film - landing on the moon - would require this film to be more than six hours long .  also , some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians , who were portrayed as evil monsters , just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan's america .  in some of contemporary interviews , kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible , and in order to do that , he portrayed russians not as they were in real life , but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s .  time has passed ; now we don't see astronauts as heroes .  in this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions , those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers .  few young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up .  but this film , sentimental reminder of the times " when future began " , perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow " mercury " astronauts' footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky .  and even if they decide to stay on earth , they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema .  
there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie .  action movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences , while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full-circle .  for fans of both genres , however , realism is key .  action fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic , and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie's end .  on this advice , director john frankenheimer ( the island of dr .  moreau ) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller , ronin .  the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing , considering the fare that's fallen into the same category over the last few years .  the script , written by j . d . zeik in his big-screen debut , approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission : impossible two years ago .  a certain number of people will be lost by this , but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times .  frankenheimer masters the script with poise , and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post-cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck .  his ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here , and ronin becomes a better movie because of it .  robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time .  he takes command and offers much gravity as the ex-spy sam , a man who's called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre ( natascha mcelhone ) recover a package .  the package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast , especially once the requisite double-crossing begins , and its role is skillfully penned by zeik .  at times , however , zeik's tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission : impossible - de niro might easily become tom cruise , the package might become cruise's computer disk .  fortunately , the focus here is almost entirely on the package , whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double-cross and why it happened .  the action content is impressive , and it lives up to the hints given in previews .  the only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full-blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness .  ronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish , but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots .  the suspense tapers off considerably by the end , a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movie's open .  considering these factors it's good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well , and it's another good bet this month .  since quality is usually sparse during the early fall months , it's definitely worth the visit .  
capsule : the director of cure brings a weird and very complex concept to the screen .  one viewing will not be enough to understand fully the premise of pulse .  the idea is something about ghosts and the internet .  the film has an amazing apocalyptic style .   , +2 ( -4 to +4 )  perhaps the most disturbing ( and disturbed ? )  filmmaker in the world is kiyoshi kurosawa .  his films all seem to have one style , bleak .  the worlds he creates are terrifying and cold .  little known in the us to date , his films deliver the kind of horror that so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable to deliver .  most of his ideas are fresh and at the same time morbid .  his 1998 film cure , with one of his niftiest ideas , is just now getting a sadly limited release in the us and hopefully enough people will see it that his name will soon be one to conjure with .  cure is probably his classic .  last year he released seance , a remake of seance on a wet afternoon .  that was perhaps a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements into a non-supernatural story .  pulse is kurosawa back on form .  taguchi , a young computer expert , is late with his delivery of some important software .  two co-workers go to his apartment and find it a dismal dark affair in spite of his computer equipment .  taguchi , acting very strangely , lets his friends look for the missing software .  meanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain .  when he fails to respond to calls his friends follow him behind the curtain and discover he has hanged himself .  if that was not horror enough the body seems to disappear leaving just a strange dark mildew-like spot on the wall .  taguchi's computer seems to have been infected with some kind of computer virus .  people whose computer gets the virus seem superficially to die via suicide .  but they are not entirely dead .  their spirits seem to remain present somehow in the real world and on the internet .  people who get the computer virus are asked if they want to see a ghost .  if they say yes , they seem to be able to see real time images of the spirits still nearby somehow .  the computer shows them impossible images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do not exist .  this is all somehow connected to heaven and hell somehow filling up and overflowing " like a computer disk . "  instead the dead seem to be staying on earth and inhabiting computer viruses .  there is some sort of passage between worlds having something to do with doors marked with red tape and strange electronic disturbances on computers .  leave it to kurosawa to find a new kind of death .  this is a film that has more weird ideas piled together than lifeforce and somehow kurosawa makes the film all work .  it may not totally convey his message of isolation and its parallels to death , but whatever it does convey is nightmarish .  kurosawa , who directs his own screenplay , ties his story into the real world with some familiar and accurate computer discussion .  frequently the plot is advanced with character hunches being assumed to be fact .  his plotting is frequently hard to follow and always very strange .  junichiro hayashi , the cinematographer who recently has been doing all of kurosawa's films , creates a dark , cold , and gloomy tone .  images are obscured by semi-lighting or are behind plastic curtain .  scenes are not milked for their horror the way american exploitation films might .  people are shot with guns but there is little if any blood in evidence .  seeing black silhouettes on computer screens is not immediately scary .  kurosawa is not going for and easy visual shock , but a deeper metaphysical dread .  of any horror filmmaker in the world , kiyoshi kurosawa is the one to watch .  i rate this metaphysical look at isolation a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .  
oliver stone's latest feature is the last one standing in the long line of biographies of american presidents .  it's a three-hour long saga about the life of one of the most hated and misunderstood leaders of the 20th century .  stone doesn't hold back anything as he digs deep inside politics and legal maneuvers of the white house .  the director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done .  at the same time he creates a very human character , a brilliant and tortured man that is caught in the dirty game of politics , which is here pictured as a wild animal .  he is simply trying to tame it .  but the occasional switch to the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the white house as events run ahead of the president's ability to control them .  stone doesn't in any way apologize for nixon .  he blames not only nixon's own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself , the system that , once set in motion , behaves with a mindlessness of its own .   " nixon " is a modern shakespeare story - a saga about a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws .  there's something almost majestic about the process : as nixon goes down in this film , there is no gloating , but a watery sigh , as of a great ship sinking .  sir anthony hopkins is staggering and plays nixon with incredible honesty and understanding , creating a very emotional picture of the 37th american president .  joan allen's magnificent and captivating performance is certainly worth an oscar statuette .  she is strong and loyal as mrs . nixon .  the rest of the cast is equally magnificent , including : james woods , j . t . walsh , paul sorvino , ed harris and bob hoskins .  everyone does a serious and demanding job , no one are disappointing .  stone never loses focus and his direction is steddy , honest and determined .  he is displaying the historical facts and at the same time concentrating at the human element .  at times he is showing to black and white showing flashbacks from nixon's youth and childhood .  the flashy editing by brian berdan and frank corwin , robert richardson's rich cinematography and john williams' musical score create a hectic and bizarre atmosphere .  the film's only fault is that it's a bit tiering and overloaded with too much political material and legal maneuvers .  still it's an honest and captivating - a solid piece of movie making .  
notting hill's trailer is awful : a laughless , schmaltzy montage .  the movie was desperately marketed to the anti-phantom menace crowd , the same lovelorn females who ignored the love letter .  and it apparently worked .  perhaps the presence of julia roberts-whose allure beyond those perfect teeth still escapes me-had a lot to do with notting hill's opening weekend success , but the film's staying power is based on word of mouth .  allow me to spread some more good buzz for notting hill .  grant stars as william thacker , a travel-bookstore owner who works and resides in a tiny english district called notting hill .  into his shop one day wanders famous actress anna scott ( roberts ) .  a common thief , some spilled orange juice , and some stilted conversation leads to their first , highly impetuous ( or is that improbable ? ) , kiss .  days later , william sneaks into her hotel suite under the guise of a magazine journalist , and so begins a passionate , albeit surreptitious , affair .   ( aside : notting hill's portrayal of press junkets is deadly accurate . )  only anna's celebrity-or william's lack thereof-threatens to drive a wedge between them .  richard curtis has tapped into fantasy we all have considered , and for at least its first half-hour the picture's " beauty and the beast " -like scenario is ( romantic ) escapism of the highest order .  as with groundhog day or pleasantville , while watching the high-concept comedy notting hill one constantly imagines him/herself in the lead ; it's william's ordinaryness that entices the spoiled and bored anna .  curtis ( who previously penned four weddings and a funeral ) is also smart enough to know that the unlikely couple's situation is not enough to fuel two hours' worth of entertainment , so some of notting hill's finest moments revolve around william's eccentric friends and family .  by now , dear reader , you've probably heard a lot about rhys ifans' performance as william's imbecilic welsh flatmate .  yes , he's a crowd pleaser , a walking sight gag , but his character is not nearly as involving as the wheelchair-bound ( and appropriately named ) bella ( mckee , the anguished waitress of naked ) or max ( tom mcinnerny ) , her lousy chef of a husband .  in the movie's best sequence , william , anna , and company sit around bloated from max's latest concoction and hold a contest : the last brownie on the table goes to the diner with the saddest life .  the scene ends only as a british writer would end it .  if anything , fantastic bits like these dull the main plot's dramatic impact .  roberts and grant , especially , are appealing , but their relationship is convolutedly interrupted too many times ( four weddings' suffered similar flaws ) , and william and anna ultimately only have one thing in common : they're lonely .   ( worth noting in roberts' and grant's favour : the ubiquitous " i'm just a girl , standing across from a boy , asking him to love her " episode is not nearly so syrupy as it appears in clips , and it features some of the best emoting either actor has ever done . )  notting hill is nonetheless enjoyable ; on the visual side of things , i especially appreciated michell's playful changing-of-the-seasons number .  if only ( and this is a surprisinly minor gripe ) he had lopped off the egregious epilogue ; for a story that thrives on what we bring to it , the filmmakers work too hard to tidy things up , leaving our imaginations in the lurch .  
well , i'll admit when i first heard about this film ( which was before dante's peak ) i could just smell what 'twister' had started .  so now it seems that we're in a full fledged return to the '70's disaster film era .  with 'twister' , 'dante's peak' , 'volcano' and soon 'flood' and james cameron's extremly expensive 'titanic'  i'll say first off i enjoyed 'volcano' much more than i did 'dantes peak' .  part of that is just being biased as i usually enjoy anything that tommy lee jones appears in .  i've been reading a lot about the movie being 'cheezy' or 'hokey' and really didn't see or think that once during the entire film .  i get bored easily and this film didn't bore me for a minute .  another thing , and boy am i bitching today ! , that bothers me is when critics and such go on about " well thats not really possible . "  you know what ?  i couldn't give a bloody damn if it's possible or not , really i couldn't .  it's a freaking movie and i don't want reality thrown in my face .  i want to be able to see the impossible , the all might " what if " to many reviewers have seen one to many movies !  the special effects are the second star to this feature .  they are so amazing that i found it hard sometimes to believe they were indeed fx and la was was not burning to the ground .  they did an incredible job and come oscar time ( if they remember ) some notice better be thrown there way .  
a bleak look at how the boston underworld operates , a film which was based on the best-seller by george v . , higgins .  it is seen through the weary eyes of a 51-year-old , small-time hood , eddie " fingers " coyle ( mitchum ) .  he got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment .  his current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 3-5 year stretch in new hampshire , something he feels will be a life sentence for him since he doesn't think he could survive prison at his age .  he is also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare .  he could have cut a deal and gotten off , if he turned his boss over to the d . a . , but he figured he would never live if he did that .  he is currently gun-running for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise ( rocco ) .  the masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank manager's house and holding his family hostage and then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them or else his family gets it .  on one of the heists , they kill a bank officer who pushes the alarm .  coyle's best friend is dillon ( boyle ) , a hit man for the mob , working as a bartender .  he is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents , as an aggressive young agent named foley ( jordan ) , who likes to be called uncle , gives dillon breathing room to operate some of his low-level crime activities and to work the bar even though he has a prison record , as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening with the gangs .  with the sentencing date closing in on him , the already convicted coyle is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time .  he contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something that goes against his grain .  thinking he made an iron-clad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire , he gives him the place where a sale of machine guns is going down , knowing full-well the young hustler ( keats ) selling the guns is a lot like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life sentence .  but foley tells him after he arrests the gun-dealer , that new hampshire wants more before they take away his jail sentence , they want him to be a full-time informer .  warning : spoiler follows in next paragraph .  the bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend .  the contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up .  coyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says , " to be young like that and have his future , he's the greatest hockey player in the world . "  dillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mob-style , having a kid who works for him dump the body in some bad section of boston .  this is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets , of the hopeless situation the low-level criminals are in , and how they are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of what horrible thing will happen next .  the city streets are ugly , the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests , whether it is betrayal or murder .  there is a fatalistic feel about their lives , something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat .  mitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs , as it overcomes a thin plot .  it makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them .  mitchum is a loser ; and , that he lived so long , is a tribute to his skills as a survivor .  but in the end , he even loses the respect he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy , as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle .  
it's hard not to recommend " the others . "  the supernatural thriller , written and directed by alejandro amen ? bar ( " open your eyes " ) , adroitly establishes and maintains a low-key atmosphere of menace .  the cinematography , by javier aguirresarobe , is as good as i have ever seen and nicole kidman gives another in her growing body of fine performances .  but the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to downright sluggish and the payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied .  overall , the film plays like a very high quality version of any number of old " twilight zone " episodes where the characters spend a great deal of time wandering about looking afraid and disoriented , only to learn they are actually a child's toy , a military test subject or a department store dummy .  watching those vintage shows and listening to the players chatter , i always wanted to shout , " get on with it ! "  as much as i appreciated the atmosphere and acting in " the others , " my reaction was much the same .  set at an island mansion off the coast of england during world war ii , the story focuses on grace ( kidman ) , who tends to her children anne ( alakina mann ) and nicholas ( james bentley ) and worries about her husband , charles ( christopher eccleston ) , a missing serviceman .  anne and nicholas suffer from photosensitivity and grace patrols the estate with the keys to all 50 doors , protecting the little ones from excess light by making sure that only one door is open at a time .  at the beginning of the film , three servants , mrs . mills ( fionnula flanagan ) , young , mute lydia ( elaine cassidy ) , and mr . tuttle ( eric sykes ) , an aging gardener , join the family .  the two that speak seem agreeable enough at first , but it soon becomes apparent that they know something that grace does not .  to make matters worse , the children are upset : nicholas is unusually jittery and anne claims to be seeing ghosts .  grace attempts to blame the troubles on the new arrivals to her home , only to realize that whatever is happening is beyond them .  that's essentially the whole story , with the tension growing until the pivotal moment when everything becomes clear .  earlier , there is an outstanding scene where grace darts outside , only to be enveloped in fold after fold of shimmering fog .  the visuals in the otherworldly sequence , courtesy of aguirresarobe , are simply astounding .  i also enjoyed the presence of religion , a rarity in films dealing with the supernatural .  grace is a christian and answers her children's questions about life and death with the assurance of a devout worshiper .  when mother is away , though , the kids speculate whether her statements are fact or folklore , just as real children do .  but those nice touches fail to enliven a film that is too slow or make up for a lackluster ending .   " the others " sets out to be a classic ghost story , but fails to grasp that special something that makes such films more than layers of mist .  
james l . brooks , one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news , returns to the big screen with this entertaining , if slightly flawed comedy .  nicholson plays melvin udall , probably the most horrible person ever on the screen .  he's racist , homophobic , and never has a good word to say to anyone .  so , nobody talks to him , except waitress carol conelly ( t . v  sitcom star hunt , who was last seen in twister , 1996 ) .  naturally , udall , conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop ( kinnear ) who nicholson hates , all hit it off in the end .  like good will hunting ( 1997 ) and titanic ( 1997 ) , even though the outcome is completely obvious , as good as it gets is an enjoyable , funny and warm comedy .  nicholson is hilarious as melvin , churning out insults with superb relish .  only nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers .  hunt is also good as waitress carol , and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson .  there's also ( thankfully ) a bit of chemistry between them .  kinnear , as the gay neighbor , seems to have a slightly underwritten role , he's more of a plot convience than a character .  although his performance is good , his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together .  in fact , the scene stealer is simon's dog , who is funnier than nicholson .  but then again , pets are always cute on screen .  providing solid support is cuba gooding , jnr ( jerry maguire , 1996 ) and yeardly smith ( who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons ) although gooding isn't as good as is character in maguire , he is still fun .  he overacts a little , but not so much as to be annoying .  smith is also good , although she has a fairly small role .  even director lawrence kasdan ( body heat , 1981 ) makes an appearance as a doctor .  but this is primarily nicholsons film , and every scene he's in , he's steals it .  he's character is so hateful , though , it's amazing that anyone talks to him at all , especially carol .  and this is the films main problem .  it's totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin .  she doesn't fall in love with him naturally , the film forces her to fall in love with him .  also , melvins character seems to go too nice , too quickly .  i would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice , loving person .  it would take a helluva long time , much longer than this film would like to make out .  brooks direction is good , though , if a bit average , but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience .  he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones ( he tends to pile on to much schmaltz ) but generally he's good .  there's also a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer .  but , generally , as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do , which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie .  the movie is a bit overlong , but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly .  overall , as good as it gets is a fun movie , even though it may be unbelivable , and certainly worth seeing ( if just for jack nicholsons performance . )  not quite as good as it gets ( pardon the bad joke ) , but still good fun .  
after the press screening of " moulin rouge , " i stood in the lobby of the theater listening to the reactions of my friends and colleagues .  everyone seemed a bit numb , understandable after sitting through a barrage of often-incongruous sounds and images .  a pal of mine simply said that he loved the film and could hardly wait to take his wife to see it .  another enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production , while a woman who flat-out hated the movie gave him the skunk eye .  when one fellow quietly stated " i've never really been a fan of musicals , " the statement surprised me because , even though the story is told almost completely through song , i didn't think of it as a musical .  there is so much going on in " moulin rouge " that " musical " seems too small a term to cover it .   " moulin rouge " is the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off to the big tub o' adjectives in search of proper words to describe the experience .  australian director baz luhrmann , the man behind " strictly ballroom " and " romeo + juliet , " fills the heads of viewers with unique camerawork , opulent imagery and songs ranging from " the sound of music " to " smells like teen spirit . "  sumptuous and beautiful , vulgar and overdone , " moulin rogue " travels through the looking glass while an ethereal stereo loaded with 50 years worth of catchy tunes operates on the " random " setting .  oh , and it has a story as well .   " it was 1899 , the summer of love . . .   " christian ( ewan mcgregor ) is a penniless young writer newly arrived in paris , " to write about truth , beauty , freedom and love , " where he encounters a group of bohemians , led by henri de toulouse-lautrec ( john leguizamo ) .  christian meets satine ( nicole kidman ) , a courtesan from the legendary moulin rogue , and his world transforms from black and white to technicolor .  at once fragile and vivacious , the dazzling red-haired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying .  christian instantly falls in love with her and satine finds herself smitten with him as well , which is quite a hindrance for someone in her profession .  working with the bohemians and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler ( jim broadbent ) , christian writes an opus modestly named " spectacular spectacular . "  zidler quickly finds a backer , the wealthy duke of monroth ( richard roxburgh ) , but there's a catch ? the duke also wants the hand of the fair satine .  as if all that isn't enough , satine has a cough , and while a cough in the real world probably indicates a cold , it rarely turns out to be anything that simple in movie land .  like a teeter-totter , " moulin rogue " moves up and down between the ridiculous and the sublime .  one of the loveliest moments comes as christine and satine commune outdoors at night , becoming part of a defiantly unrealistic parisian cityscape straight from a book of fairy tales .  together they dance , while serenaded by the man in the moon ( alessandro safina provides the vocals ) , apparently transported from the classic georges m ? li ? s silent film to guard the nocturnal sky .  other scenes merely traffic in everything-and-the-kitchen-sink overload .  the cavorting of toulouse-lautrec and his comrades gets strained at times and some of their overt comedy , accompanied by cartoon sound effects , is overly reminiscent of the frenzied farce that sitcoms like " bewitched " beat into the ground .  of course , sensory overload was exactly what baz luhrmann had in mind .   " we never heard from baz to turn it down , " one of the actors told the los angeles times .   " it was always , 'more !  more ! ' "  the director even sent a note to his cast reading , " i dare you to make me say you've gone too far . "  the musical numbers reflect his attitude .  one knockout piece , the " elephant love medley , " incorporates the beatles' " all you need is love , " u2's " in the name of love , " dolly parton's " i will always love you " and elton john and bernie taupin's " your song . "  need more ?  how about " diamonds are a girl's best friend " spiced with portions of " material girl ? "  luhrmann's cast offers a wide variety of approaches that , together , add up to something messy , but often wonderful .  ewan mcgregor is extremely likable as christian , emphasizing the sincerity of the love-struck poet .  mcgregor's singing voice is robust and adds vigor at just the right moments .  once labeled the " ice queen , " nicole kidman melts that characterization with a sizzling , yet tender , performance .  she handles the songs adroitly , although her voice sounds a bit thin in the upper range .  veteran character actor jim broadbent is suitably larger than life as ringmaster zidler ? wait until you see him perform " like a virgin . "  as the buffoonish duke , richard roxburgh proves to be the film's weakest link , although i'm sure he was simply following instructions .  i suspect " moulin rogue " will be one of those love-it-or-hate-it films .  while i didn't completely love it , i most certainly liked it a lot .  over the course of a year , i see well over 300 movies , and most of them look like xeroxes of each other .   " moulin rogue " is an original , and an original , even a flawed one , is a thing to be cherished .  
at first glance , daylight would seem like your typical disaster movie .  on second glance it looks that way too .  although , as typical disaster movies go , daylight isn't that bad .  admittedly , it seems to rip off a great deal of its plot devices from disaster flicks of days gone by ( think poseidon adventure ) .  but the decent dialogue and surprisingly good acting make up for the " haven't i seen this scene somewhere before ? "  feeling that creeps up all too often during the film .  sylvester stallone stars as the recently fired head of new york's emergency response team .  by sheer luck , he is in the right place at the right time when disaster strikes the unaware inhabitants of this little film .   " what disaster is that ? "  you ask , as you inch ever closer to the edge of your seat .  glad you asked .  through a whole sequence of entirely probable events ( about as probable as hitting the lottery ) a large explosion takes place in the lincoln tunnel running under the hudson river in new york city .  the explosion results in the tunnel collapsing at both ends , which causes not only massive loss of life , but traps a dozen people inside the wreckage of the tunnel .  good old sly , who is only feet away from entering the tunnel when it collapses , offers his services to the rescuers , who gladly accept it .  sly then enters the tunnel through a vent shaft ( think judge dredd ) which he can only go in , and not out off , and proceeds to try to rescue those trapped inside .  so begins the fun , but the fun has to be quick , because this tunnel has started to spring a leak .  the acting is about what you would expect of a stallone movie .  not superb by any means , but far above some of his other films ( think judge dredd again ) .  daylight's acting is probably average , or a little above , in terms of this sort of genre , starring this particular star .  amy brenneman is the only actor of any note , and she does a pretty good job as stallone's reluctant helper .  oh yeah , stallone's real life son , sage , is in this too .  sage -- nice name .  i guess it could be worse , he could have been named nutmeg or parsley .  note to sage -- you are still young .  go to school and get a good education -- you don't have a future in acting .  the plot runs along the same lines as the acting -- interesting , but predictable .  mostly due to the fact that it was pretty well recycled from a dozen other action flicks .  the biggest problem with a film of this nature is that they try to cram too many things into the movie .  as soon as the cast clears one seemingly impossible hurdle , another one seems to pop right up , even worse than the last one .  i realize that it wouldn't be much of a movie otherwise , but it does make the movie a bit predictable .  adding to the predictability is the cast of characters , which of course , has to include at least one or two difficult people who want to do things their own way and think the qualified guy ( in this case stallone ) doesn't know what he is doing .  why is it in disaster movies we can never have everyone agree with each other and all work together ?  would this be too much to ask ?  can't we all just get along ?  special effects weren't bad -- but i've certainly seen better .  some of the scenes , while fun to watch , were such blatant rip-offs that you had to wonder if scripts from old movies were just copied verbatim .  especially all of the scenes that involved anything underwater ( the tunnel , of course , starts to flood ) .  i really expected gene hackman , roddy mcdowell and ernest borgnine to appear at any minute -- i wasn't sure if i was watching daylight or the poseidon adventure .  i suppose if you have to rip off a movie for good ideas , the poseidon adventure is a good one to use .  the underwater sequences ( aside from the deja vu ) were very well shot and worked fairly well .  they were the best part of the movie by a long shot .  better than average stallone flick .  i realize that's not saying much when the man has judge dredd on his resume .  but certainly not up to the standards of cliffhanger .  daylight is a fun movie , and as long as you aren't expecting a whole lot you might even be pleasantly surprised .  
produced by robert lantos & stephen j . roth  directed by douglas williams  mpaa : not rated ( though from language , violence , medical-gross-outs , and sexual content , i'd put it at pg )  though made in canada , " overdrawn at the memory bank " traces its roots to the bbc school of film production .  using , for the most part , cheap computer and video special effects , chyron text , wildlife documentary footage , and sets that are sometimes obviously faked up , it nonetheless manages to tell a good enough science fiction story that by the time you're twenty minutes into it , you should be hooked .  raul julia plays aram fingal , a drone data processing worker for novicorp whose active imagination and predilection for hacking gets him into trouble with authority .  caught watching " casablanca " on his desk monitor , fingal is sentenced to " doppling " rehabilitation--he is to spend forty-eight hours in the body of a baboon .   ( how exactly this is supposed to rehabilitate him is anybody's guess . )  as it happens , thanks to a visiting schoolboy's prank , his body is temporarily misplaced , and his mind has to be shunted into the central computer to keep him alive until they can find it .  as time ticks away before his memory cube self-destructs , the frantic search for his body is on . . . while  fingal first creates a virtual reality fantasy world , then finds there's no better way to hack the system than from the inside .  during the chaos , computer technician apollonia james ( linda griffiths ) maintains contact with fingal through a datalink , manifesting several different times to offer advice or warnings .  over the course of their interactions , interest on both their parts grows into a budding romance .  given that " casablanca " is fingal's favorite film , and the basis for his fantasy world , a great deal of the movie is homage to " casablanca " .  in fact , the humphrey bogart and peter lorre characters make appearances ( played by julia in a dual role and louis negin , respectively ) in a bar called " the place " .  julia's portrayal of bogart is passable , and avoids becoming the " schweethaat " -spouting parody seen in cartoons .  negin's peter lorre is quite credible , and easily the best peter lorre i've ever seen who wasn't the real thing .  the two of them , as characters created by fingal's imagination , serve as aspects of his personality , driving him on in his quest to hack the computer system .  those aren't the only casablanca characters to put in appearances .  the sydney greenstreet character also happens to be around . . . as " the fat man " , the alternate aspect of the film's main villain , the novicorp chairman ( donald c . moore ) .  while fingal's body is lost , the fat man tries to stop him from hacking the system . . . with  less than salutory results .  it's interesting to note the futuristic slang words that are thrown about left and right during the film , in the best golden-age science fiction tradition .  words like " dopple " , " psychist " , " computech " , " cinema " , and " reconst " are apparently in common use .  and while people of today may well laugh at fourteen years past's idea of futuristic data processing clerks , some aspects of this film are surprisingly perfectly in keeping with the way we think of " virtual reality " today .  as cyberpunk films go , this may not be a staple of the genre , but it's definitely recommended viewing .  the special effects are very primitive , placing this production in the realm of low-to-medium-budget television .  the music is completely electronic-synthesized , which fits the low budget but isn't really out of keeping with the genre .  however , the writing quite makes up for it .  there are some very funny moments , and quite a few little in-jokes that one needs to have seen " casablanca " to appreciate properly .  all in all , i give " overdrawn at the memory bank " a .  
i like movies with albert brooks , and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks .  lost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies .  his humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today , inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator .  you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film , while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent " talk films " which are finding their way into theaters .  the situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with , but even if we can't , brooks has the talent to make them comfortable , and therefore we laugh .  teenagers and jim carrey fans probably won't find an albert brooks movie very funny , but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will .  put simply , brooks' comedy is intelligent .  mother is albert brooks' latest film , and it does not disappoint .  brooks plays john henderson , a middle-aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce .  he makes an attempt at dating , but fails miserably .  he then has dinner with his brother jeff ( rob morrow ) , a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life .  jeff has a good job , a loving family , and most of all , a warm relationship with their mother beatrice ( debbie reynolds ) .  after dinner , john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice , and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky-dory the dialog is .  in comparison , beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him , and john gives it right back to her .  at the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john's life , she says , " i love you , " and john replies with , " i know you think you do . "  the thing is , beatrice is not overt with her criticisms , but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit-picking and guilt loading .  it's the kind that goes something like , " yes , dear , i think you do that wonderfully , but . . . . "  it seems as though nothing he does makes her happy .  there's always the big but .  john believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women , either because of his flawed self-esteem caused by his need for validation , or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner .  he comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home , he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out , and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is .   " a great experiment " , he calls it .  brooks' own brand of humor really shines in this film , especially in the interaction john has with his mother .  there's a scene where john has just arrived at his mother's house , and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito , and having explained to his mother about the " great experiment " , beatrice asks , " now explain to me again why you don't want to stay at a hotel . "  she still doesn't get it , and it is absolutely hilarious .  in the same scene , we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh .  she apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over .  when john points out the ice on the sherbet , beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze .   " you've named the ice ? "  asks john .  he's also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator , such as a twenty-pound block of cheese .   " the freezer was a good invention , " says john , " but it's not supposed to be used for everything .  that's why it's smaller than the refrigerator . "  it's something most of us find strangely familiar .  brooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur .  for example , in defending your life , his and meryl streep's characters are in a comedy club having a discussion .  when they're finished and walk out , brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line , " and so the moral is , if you have to fart , go outside ! "  you don't know what the joke was because you couldn't hear him during the entire scene , but i must have laughed for the next five minutes , it seemed so out of context .  in this film , brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene .  i don't want to give them away , but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past .  john's purpose for staying with his mother is to learn , and we as the audience learn right along with him .  his mother is not the fascinating type to begin with , but as john spends more time with her , we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth .  watching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way .  on screen , brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character : you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world .  in a way , he's very much like yosarian of catch-22 , expect with something of an attitude .  casting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect .  she assumes the part with ease , even moving and speaking a little slowly , and is just so adorable it's hard to get mad at her character .  this only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her .  as his first choice , brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice , but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband , who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer's disease .  that may be just as well , since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely .  rob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother's favorite and , for all his success in his job and family , is slowly exposed as a mama's boy .  the only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes .  a solid connection is not really made between john's troubles and his reasons for living with his mother .  additionally , the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals , and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting , how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this ? :  beatrice : you must think i'm some kind of moron .  john : no , i think your someone who thinks i'm a moron .  beatrice : well , it takes one to know one .  
every once in a while , when an exceptional family film comes along , i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been ; with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children , it is remarkable how many non-disney films disappear in a couple of weeks .  now i see that in so doing , i have unfairly ghettoized these films .  so i am issuing my challenge not just to parents , but to anyone who wants to support smart , funny , energetic film-making : see matilda .  see it in a theater , rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video .  see the best film i have seen in 1996 .  not the best children's film . . . the  best film .  period .  based on a story by roald dahl , it tells of young matilda wormwood ( mara wilson ) , an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents : harry ( danny devito ) , a crooked used car salesman ; and zinnia ( rhea perlman ) , a simple-minded bingo addict .  the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists , and when they do , it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books .  when they finally do send her to school , it is to crunchem hall , a bleak place run by cruel , child-hating miss agatha trunchbull ( pam ferris ) .  but things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher , miss honey ( embeth davidtz ) , who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness .  matilda also discovers another special talent -- the ability to move things with her mind -- which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbull's cruelty .  it was this spring's james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them , and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda .  and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton , matilda soars on the cock-eyed direction of danny devito .  devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses , and he contributes some memorable images .  in one scene , an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pig-tails and flung through the air like a throwing hammer ; later , an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert .  matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale .  it is also characteristic of the best children's tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don't realize that they are learning them .  there is a hilarious moment when matilda's television-addicted father snatches away the book she is reading ( in a wicked joke , he thinks _moby dick_ is pornographic ) and forces her to watch an inane game show ( hosted by jon lovitz ) in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around .  matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment , and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child -- that because " i'm big and you're little , i'm right and you're wrong . "  more specifically , it has as its heroine an intelligent , self-confident girl who struggles successfully against other people's notions of how she should behave .  it is no coincidence that matilda was co-written by robin swicord , who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women .  finally , matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment : it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word .  devito knows enough to make matilda fast-paced and appealing to children , taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy , including a great chase through her dark house .  the child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable , with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character .  but there are also many , many delights for adults , including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matilda's classmates recite in sing-song fashion ; there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda's father .  i can't imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted .  matilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling .  i will see it again , and years from now i will watch it with my children .  and now i will stop , because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin , and there is a seat in that theater you should be in , if you have a child or ever were a child .  
susan granger's review of " osmosis jones " ( warner bros . )  if the farrelly brothers taught anatomy & physiology in school , no one would cut ever class .  this hip , live action/animation story begins as a monkey snatches a hard-boiled egg from frank , a zookeeper ( bill murray ) , who grabs it back , drops it , then gobbles up the contaminated morsel , explaining , " if it hits and ground and you pick it up within 10 seconds , you can eat it . "  like " fantastic voyage " ( 1966 ) , the pseudo-science animation then takes over when his body's immune system contacts traffic control as an ingested virus hits the digestive system : " be on the alert for illegal organisms ! "  eager to right " a stomach evacuation mistake " he once made , a cocky , clever , courageous white blood cell ( chris rock ) declares , " this is a crime scene ! "  and teams up with a conscientious " phi beta capsule " 12-hour cold remedy called drixenol ( david hyde pierce ) to chase down and destroy the deadly " red death " virus ( laurence fishburne ) that's determined to take frank down in 48 hours , beating ebola and e . coli to a medical record .  watch out for mucus mudslides , chaos in cerebellum hall and the detritus from booger dam ( runny nose ) , along with comic turns from molly shannon and chris elliot , plus the voices of william shatner and brandy norwood .  peter and bobby farrelly , along with writer mark hyman and animation directors piet kroon and tom sito , have turned their penchant for gross-out comedy , encompassing flatulence , festering sores and " popping a pimple without a permit , " into a funny , farrelly-funny family film .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " osmosis jones " is a wildly imaginative , original , explosive 7 .  and perhaps , as they're laughing , kids will learn where to find their uvula , along with nuggets about nutrition and hygiene .  
 " seven " is one of the best mystery movies i've ever seen .  it's extremely intriguing and suspenseful , but it's also quite fun .  it's a serial killer mystery , but you don't care so much about making the killer pay as much as hope they just catch the killer .  the story is a cops-on-the-trail-of-serial-killer mystery .  someone is murdering people who are offenders of " the seven deadly sins . "  a fat man ( gluttony ) was forced to eat himself to death , a lawyer ( greed ) is slaughtered by his own rich possessions . . .  i could go on but revealing any more would give away entirely too much .  what makes this film so unique is the characterization of the " good guys " which makes the unseen villain seem so vile .  brad pitt stars is quite excellent as detective david mills , the cocky rookie .  however , morgan freeman is even better as detective william sommerset , the wise veteran on the verge of retirement ( and he doesn't get killed by the end ) .  there is a great sense of camaraderie here which often provides for a breath of comic relief .  this is impressive because the mood is so tense , and the fact that it can be down-played as well as it is here ( let alone at all ) is quite an accomplishment .  the setting takes place in present day new york city but the art direction is able to give the city a feeling of the evil , scary place many believe it to be .  the production design is superb , in the spirit of " batman " and " the crow , " this film embodies the gothic mood .  the way the words fade in and out , along with the freaky nine inch nails music really add a lot to the story on a subconscious level - even the credits are scary !  the killer's victims have no connections at all , and thus mills and sommerset don't have much to go on to solve the case .  they can only wait for the next murder to occur which makes for tremendous suspense .  we become just as tense and worried as the detectives because of this thick atmosphere of the unknown .  not that many films have such an interesting and intriguing screenplay as this .  the only problem i had with the film is the way in which mills and sommerset are lead to a suspect .  let's just say it seems a little too " mystery movie , " or too convenient in other words .  when they are led to a suspect by the name of john doe , a terrific chase scene ensues .  this is a typical thrilling element , but it works perfectly here because of the process of the story .  if anything , this film is the epitome of twist endings .  i don't have to tell you mills and sommerset finally catch the criminal , but the way in which this happens is surprising .  there is a scene of intriguing philosophy between the killer and the detectives , and even though he's obviously insane , his charisma makes for some good points .  what's even more surprising is the last few scenes themselves as the suspense comes to a terrific climax as the film's resolution comes down to a question of what justice really is .   " seven " is not just a film about crime , but about the evil within man .  john doe felt he was doing society a favor by ridding it of " scum . "  but as justified as he makes himself seem , we must never be tempted by such twisted ideals of justice .  
the heartbreak kid ( reviewed on aug . 26th/1998 )  starring charles grodin , cybill sheppard , eddie albert  in " the heartbreak kid " , charles grodin plays one of the most unbelievably obnoxious characters i've seen on screen in a long time .  he's a guy who spends virtually the entire running time of the movie bullshitting his way from one situation to another .  i doubt he ever expressed any genuine feeling at all during the film .  as the film opens , he has just gotten married , and is on the way to miami beach for his honeymoon .  halfway there , he begins to resent his bride .  by the time he arrives at his hotel and has met the cybill sheppard character , he is ready to divorce his wife .  as played by grodin , this character is the type of person that nothing will ever be good enough for him .  the phrase " the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence " was practically written with him in mind .  however , if he finds something he really wants , he will pursue it for as long as it takes .  the only problem is , once he has it , he immediately loses interest .  the end of " the heartbreak kid " is both hilarious and sad for that very reason .  charles grodin is at his smarmy best here , and sheppard is quite appealing as the object of grodin's desire .  however , the real scene stealer is jeannie berlin , daughter of director elaine may , as grodin's whiny bride .  she owns every scene that she's in , and makes you almost want to root for what the grodin character is trying to do .   " the heartbreak kid " was written by neil simon and it shows .  simon loves to deconstruct and analyze human relationships , and he's at the top of his game here .  as maddeningly obnoxious as the grodin character is , he's the type of guy that everyone knows .  the character of george costanza on " seinfeld " seems to have been modelled after him .  the only problem with the film is that it's not that funny , and it's billed as a comedy .  as much as i could see the realism in the characters , it would have been nice to have a chuckle here and there .   " the heartbreak kid " is not a date movie .  it has an extremely negative view of relationships , so seeing it with a girlfriend/boyfriend , could be hazardus to your health .  
clint eastwood , in his ripe old age , is cashing one talent in for another .  midnight in the garden of good and evil is an eastwood-directed film clint isn't even in , and it's damn good .  adapted from a best-selling john berendt novel based on true events , this movie is set in the bizarre georgia town of savannah , where people walk invisible dogs and attach horseflies to their head .  and that's just the mayor .  as director and producer , eastwood contributes a self- indulgent but very competent 150 minutes , neatly balancing drama , suspense and humor .  like all great movies , midnight in the garden has a lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves , and not from some contrived , juvenile intrusion .  the acting , from big-time stars john cusack and kevin spacey , is as good as you'd expect , but it's the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm .  cusack plays a free-lance reporter sent to savannah to write a fluff story for town & country magazine about one of eccentric millionaire spacey's parties .  lots of food , beverages and gunplay .  yes , an employee of spacey's has a huge argument in front of cusack and later turns up dead .  it seems like a simple matter of self- defense -- the guy threatened spacey , shot at him , missed , then spacey took him out -- but being a movie , there's much more to it than that , and cusack decides to stay in town and write a book about the murder , a book which will eventually become a movie he will star in .  the weird circle of entertainment .  this is where the stable of supporting characters comes in .  there's the requisite sexy woman ( alison " nepotist's daughter " eastwood ) , the strange piano player , the voodoo woman and the transvestite .  miss chablis deserves a paragraph of his/her own , as the stealer of every scene she appears in -- what would this movie be without the castilian scene and her testimony ?  chablis , playing herself , is five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul , but never seems exploited as the movie's comic relief or out of place in a basically serious movie .  there are also a fair share of courtroom scenes , which these days almost never seem welcome in a movie , but even here clint manages to keep the movie fascinating .  certainly the characterizations of the judge and spacey's lawyer both help immensely , as does having the fly-guy as the jury's foreman .  it's here we realize the case boils down to an indictment of spacey's homosexuality .  yes , spacey had a sexual relationship with the dead man -- before he shot him , of course .  midnight in the garden of good and evil isn't a classic , but it is one of the better celebrity-directed , true-story best-seller adaptations out there .  likewise , no one from this movie will be getting any oscar nominations , but the performances are all great .  in fact , i'd almost recommend that the academy add a best supporting transvestite category .  serving america for more than 1/25th of a century !  
capsule : suprisingly more of a comedy than a straight action flick , which isn't necessarily a bad thing .  not exactly oscar caliber , but one helluva bullet-riddled good time .  extended review : you know , i remember when hitmen were evil , murderous scum .  alas , the times are a-changin' .  in a recent string of movies , hitmen are suddenly wise- cracking , fun-loving killers-with-hearts .  this brings us to hong kong director kirk wong's first american feature , the big hit .  oddly enough , about the same time last year a similar film , grosse point blank , was released .  advertised as a quirky comedy with hints of action , it turned out to have a suprising dosage of it .  the big hit is quite the opposite .  it was hyped as " the new film from producer john woo " , so one would it expect lots of stylized killing and action .  however , there's a sore lack of it , which is about the only thing wrong with the big hit .  the film starts out with mel smiley and his cohorts doing a job on a white slaver .  mel , played by mark wahlberg in a dopey , milquetoast role , is a killing machine ; he flips , spins , even breakdances whilst popping caps .  sadly , he doesn't get a chance to do much of it .  except for the beginning set piece and the last 20 twenty minutes or so , the film is in comedy mode .  the action , at least what there is of it , is prime cut stuff .  wong , after numerous hong kong features , makes quite a nice u . s . debut .  however , his pacing is a bit off , with the action sequences only bookending the movie and not lasting long enough .  they start off electrifying and fresh , but just kinda stop .  normally , this would hamper a movie to the point of being unenjoyable .  luckily , we have ben ramsey's screenplay , a bitingly funny piece of work .  the only problem is there might be too much humor , one joke makes you laugh so hard you miss the next few .  some of best gags include an oriental film maker down on his luck and one of mel's hitmen pals that has just discovered onanism .  the only problem is how some of the minor characters are handled , some being there only for a laugh , which sometimes works , sometimes doesn't .  overall , the big hit may have it's flaws , but it makes up for them in a stylishly directed , gut-wrenchingly funny joyride .  definately one of the better ways to spend two hours .  
available in an all new video edition from arrow entertainment ( $29 . 95 ) , with an introduction by david carradine , written & produced by wayne j . keeley  f . w . murnau's career ended sadly and prematurely .  the german director of such classics as " sunrise " and " the last laugh " died in a car accident shortly after signing a deal to make american pictures at paramount .  murnau was reportedly a giant man , well over six feet , a towering figure probably incapable of anything but a grand entrance .  which brings us to " nosferatu : a symphony of horror " : surely he felt a kinship with his title character , the looming vampire embodied by intimidating max schreck ; in one of the most indelible images in film history , silent or otherwise , schreck rises from his grave , gnarled hands outstretched , and he's so big that part of his head is cropped by the top of the frame .  the plot of " nosferatu . . . "  is lifted--unauthorized--from bram stoker's " dracula " .  the british hutter is an eager real estate man assigned to visit and discuss future living arrangements with count orlock of transylvania .  he leaves behind girlfriend emily , only to discover orlock's secret--he's a bloodsucker--and struggle to return to england before the nosferatu reaches his lady love .  in addition to schreck's performance , the cinematography and effects are outstanding .  arrow video's digitally remastered version of the classic is something of a mixed-coffin .  the cover art features a red-tinted , hairy , goateed vampire staring straight at you , his fanged mouth agape , while the bodies of two sexy , writhing women entice you below .  trouble is , murnau's monster is pale-faced , bald , pointy-eared , and non-goateed , and there isn't a single sexy , writhing woman to be found in his movie .  this sort of misleading packaging makes little sense when one recalls the countless number of ghouslish scenes in the film from which cool cover art could have been extracted .  additionally , notifying the viewer that this is in fact murnau's film seems like afterthought since his name and the genuine title are written in small print below our goateed vampire .  that said , a good mastering job has been performed on the film itself .  the original elements are not in the best condition--non-studio silents were unlucky in their preservation-- so we're still dealing with a slightly washed out , scratched , jittering image .  but at least the day and night scenes are tinted sepia and blue , respectively , especially helpful to an audience who may question nosferatu's waltzing around during what seems like sunlight ( it took a lot of light to expose stock in the twenties ) .  the title cards have been redone , and they are legible , accurate , and digitally altered to flicker--a very nice touch .   ( even the opening copyright warning flickers ! )  the score has been replaced by music from type o negative , a hard-rock group , arguably gothic , and their songs underscore the film nicely-- certainly the coolest video a band can ask for .  when our hero , hutter , first steps onto the doomed carriage to count orlock's castle , we hear a well-timed " now you're dead ! "  from lead singer peter steele .  david carradine makes an appropriately vampiric host ; he fiddles with a blade and cane while introducing the film .  after the feature , which runs about 63 minutes , is included a new music video from type o negative , the black-and-white fang-fest " black no . 1 " .  of course , " nosferatu : a symphony of horror " is the main attraction , and while my latest viewing raised questions ( why is the woman called emily in the title cards but " mina " --as bram stoker called her--in hutter's letters ? , for instance ) , it made me realize how much this movie has inspired and been stolen from .  coppola's 1992 " bram stoker's dracula " owes a great stylistic debt to murnau's masterpiece , but the one thing it couldn't thieve was the original's abstract charms .  this latest incarnation from arrow will probably- -like the rescored " metropolis " a few years back--turn a silent film into more palpable entertainment for the latest generation of film freaks .  
what do you get when you combine clueless and dumb and dumber ?  to answer the question , you get director david mirkin's new comedy romy and michele's high school reunion .  romy white ( mira sorvino , mighty aprhodite ) and michele weinberger ( lisa kudrow , tv's friends ) have been inseparable buddies since they graduated from sagebrush high in 1987 .  however , when former classmate heather mooney ( janeane garafolo , the truth about cats and dogs ) confronts romy about the 10 year reunion , she is astounded that she forgot .  watching pretty woman for the um-teenth time , they are reminded of how they wouldn't let julia roberts' character shop in the expensive stores because of her appearance .  then it hits them : they are not successful .  what are she and michele going to do ?  romy's instant solution is lose some weight off their already slender frames , " bag a couple of boyfriends , " and get jobs .  romy says this will be easy , but michele retorts that if it is so easy , why hadn't they already done it .  robin schiff's script keeps the show moving with some nice one-liners .  one of the best has romy reminiscing about her life's battle against the bathroom scales .   " i was so lucky getting mono , " she says looking at her thinnest high school picture .   " that was like the best diet ever . "  the casting for the film is so perfect that one begins to suspect that the leads were chosen and then the script was developed .  romy and michele use their high school yearbook to discuss the caste system at their high school .  the film's editor david finfer dissolves the stills from the yearbook to live action flashbacks which makes the past come to life .  at sagebrush high , the hierarchy consisted of the a group ( cheerleaders ) , the b group ( drama club ) and the c group ( nerds ) .  romy and michele were none of the above .  ridiculed as " the weirdoes , " they were constant targets for abuse .  even though they were quite attractive , they had so much fun being together that they did not care about the others .  that they make their own outlandish clothes helped keep the wall around them .  complementing romy and michele's lightness , is janeane garofalo as the dark , pudgy heather mooney .  heather , who invented a new cigarette paper for cigarettes with " twice the taste in half the time for the gal on the go , " has the success and the money that they would like .  heather was even more of an outsider than they were in high school .  garofalo's one-dimensional role is only a side show .  this is a two person film with the other characters there merely for the two leads to bounce their lines off of .  the genuine chemistry between sorvino and kudrow makes for a sweet and sometimes touching comedy .  they have so much fun acting out their parts , their enjoyment spreads to the audience .   ,  
you know you're in for a truly different cinematic experience the moment you realize steve buscemi has been cast as the movie in question's most normal character .  such is the case with " the big lebowski , " joel and ethan coen's first venture since their " fargo " nabbed nationwide acclaim and a mantlepiece of academy award nods .  there's no need to fear that the coens suffered creative burnout with that accomplishment , because " lebowski " is an effort that makes words like " strange " and " unusual " seem like an understatement .  thanks in part to delicious characterization and an all-encompassing sense of humor , the film is a smashing success .  the central oddball here is the dude ( jeff bridges ) , an unemployed cad whose ambitions appear to be zilch beyond smoking pot , drinking beer and going bowling ( are you college students already rooting for him , or what ? ) .  one night , a pair of thugs break into his house and pee on his carpet , a threatening act that's supposed to be carried out against a famous pasadena millionaire ( david huddleston ) who shares his birth name -- jeff lebowski -- with the dude .  once the dude realizes this coincidence , he visits the big lebowski in hopes to claim reparations for his soiled rug , and is back to his normal life with alley pals walter ( john goodman ) , a hotheaded vietnam vet , and donny ( buscemi ) , a mild-mannered surfer , before too long .  soon , though , lebowski's trampy trophy wife bunny ( tara reid ) is kidnaped and held for a hefty ransom , and he turns to the dude for help .  it seems bunny's troubles are related to a line of work she's kept secret from her husband -- she's actually an adult film star and is very in debt with a shady producer named jackie treehorn .  the dude , now on lebowski's payroll , accepts the offer and agrees to handle the money drop ; walter tags along and insists that the dude keep the cash for himself .  chaos obviously ensues , and the dude eventually finds himself in hot water with cops , crooks and lebowski's ultra-eccentric artist daughter maude ( julianne moore ) .   " the big lebowski " deserves to win the coens the same amount of acclaim that " fargo " did ; while that 1996 black comedy was certainly a better film , " lebowski " is at least as breathtakingly imaginative .  the movie boasts a mile-high absurdity level that sometimes threatens to topple over , but thankfully never does .  the coens ( joel directed , ethan produced and both wrote ) keep you in stitches as they unravel their exceedingly loopy tale , and must be commended for juggling a number of people and subplots one would expect to find in a robert altman flick .  whether we're watching bridges fend off a marmet in his bathtub or moore don viking duds and dance in a busby berkeley-esque dream sequence , " the big lebowski " is immensely lively .  there are those who will dislike this film , but not because it's boring .  the cast has a great deal of fun with the bounteous material they're given .  bridges exudes a likeable , surprisingly sweet presence ; his dude sure isn't the cleanest guy around , but you'd still follow him to another movie .  goodman merits 1998's first oscar consideration , as walter's manic temper is one of " the big lebowski " 's many highlights ; the same goes for moore , whose throaty , delectable performance as maude is a hilarious hoot .  john turturro may very well steal the movie with his two scenes as a colorful bowler from a rival faction .  sam elliott's rambling narration gets the film off to a solid start .  and some will recognize peter stormare -- " fargo " 's silent heavy -- as carl hungus , a porn star who's really a samurai sword-wielding german nihilist and has-been pop star .  only in its final third does the movie falter , with a couple of loose plot threads and some cast members who quickly disappear and never emerge for a curtain call .  these flaws are forgivable , though -- the coens have crafted a tale so rich with personality that it's hard to look at the final product with anything but a big grin on your face .  without a doubt , " the big lebowski " is the best film so far this year .  sure , we're only three months in and the competition ( " deep rising , " " desperate measures , " " the wedding singer , " etc . ) has been pretty bland , but it's still the gospel truth .  maybe during next awards season , " lebowski " won't be a far cry from " fargo .

 ( warning to those who have not seen seven : this review contains some spoiler information . )  seven is a powerful , fully-realized film on the level of the silence of the lambs .  it is a disturbing film that accomplishes its biggest of goals--it occupies the viewers mind long after the closing credits have rolled .  while this film is not for the squeamish , there is no denying that seven demands attention , for it is a film that transcends its genre in both style and substance .  for starters , classifying seven as a " thriller " would not be an altogether complete classification of this film .  while i was genuinely thrilled throughout , i would rather call seven an " intense drama , " because that is what it delivers--meaningful scenes with a relentlessness that does not readily let up .  part of director david finchers accomplishment is in style .  he seems to have a knack for knowing exactly how the average person fears something as " simple " as a corpse .  and visually , fincher shows us the remains of murder victims in all-too-realistic and graphic terms ( courtesy of rob bottin's always-grisly special effects ) .  throw in the appropriate but not-to-be-underestimated effects of lighting and a foreboding score and the result is a technical masterpiece of the murder scene .  these scenes alone are quite impressive ; as fascinating as they are harrowing .  yet , seven is more than just a technical accomplishment .  in addition to style , fincher supplies substance .  seven has compelling characters that it wants us to know and understand , and fincher ties them all together in a completely pessimistic view of society .  detective william somerset ( morgan freeman ) is a man who has nearly given up on the world .  its easy to see why .  the world doesn't make sense .   ( somerset drives this point home with a rather ghastly story of a robbery victim who was attacked just blocks from the police precinct .  after knocked down and robbed of his wallet , the attacker stabbed the helpless man in both eyes . )  why should somerset believe that by following this murder investigation and " picking up the pieces " he will be able to catch the killer ?  somersets new partner , david mills ( brad pitt ) has not given up on the world , perhaps because he is still young ( and perhaps by having this optimism he's naive in this films portrayal of the world ) .  he completely disagrees with somersets abandonment of hope .  however , david's wife ( gwyneth paltrow ) has so much fear of her urban surroundings , she isn't even sure if she wants to * tell * her husband about her recent pregnancy , let alone carry it until birth and attempt to raise it in this environment .  these three characters are all performed with skill and authenticity that makes them feel like real people and not the typical hollywood characters a lesser film might have offered .  and in addition to making clear how each of these characters sees the world , fincher gives us support for * why * they feel the way they do .  but if there's one character that underlines the message seven is trying to convey , it has to be the killer , john doe ( kevin spacey ) .  seven's payoff lies in its ability to allow us to see how the killer views the world and what drives him to do what he does .  one important thing to remember about doe is how easy it is to simply dismiss him as a " psycho , " with no motives behind his slayings .  this is exactly the mistake mills makes .  in the extremely intense and superbly performed closing scenes , were allowed to see that doe is , in his mind , merely a product of society .  he's a killer who kills those who are bringing society down .  in his mind he didn't kill " innocent " people , and , perhaps , they were not completely innocent ( but , then again , who is ? ) .  hes absolutely infuriated that mills believes that the murder victims were innocent .  really , seven doesn't just comment on the superficial obviousness of how screwed-up john doe is .  seven makes larger statements about how screwed-up society is , hinting that society's degradation is simply conducive of creating more john does .  besides the stylistic and larger-issue arguments for seeing this film , i recommend seven because it is , after all , also a very slick and well-made thriller .  it features exciting plot developments , commanding performances , lots of suspense , and a conclusion that is chilling , riveting , and quite unfair .  but then again , its a cruel world .  
i remember hearing about this film when it first appeared at cannes over a year ago , picking up the grand jury prize at the festival .  'holocaust comedy receives standing ovation' , the headlines read .  intrigued by this statement , i looked up information on the film and found that , sure enough , life is beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years .  even though the movie was extremely well-received by critics and public alike , i couldn't help but be disgusted at this notion ; human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated .  only now do i see the error of my ways .  after finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time , it became clear that it is not , as the headlines proclaimed , a " holocaust comedy " ; on the contrary , life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps .  rather , it focuses on the relationship between a father and his son , who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of their situation .  roberto benigni ( who also wrote and directed the movie ) stars as guido orefice , a chaplin-inspired clown and all round jolly guy who , as the film opens , is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher ( nicoletta braschi , benigni real life spouse ) .  through the course of the first hour or so , we see guido striving to get the attention of this " beautiful princess " , as he calls her .  employing the magic of laughter , the italian comedian wins her heart and together , they raise a young boy named giosue ( child actor giorgio cantarini ) .  life treats them well until hitler's minions rise to power , and the family is whisked away to a german camp , where guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his son's innocence no matter what the sacrifice .  granted , it contains some uproariously funny moments both in and out of the concentration camp , but it does not pull a " hogan's heros " and make light of the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews .  somehow , it achieves hilarity without disrespecting it's gravely serious subject .  so , we've established that life is beautiful is not a " holocaust comedy " .  but , there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me .  the film , despite critic's declarations of it being a " triumph of the human spirit " , is no such thing ; not in my eyes , anyway .  some have called the story an " affirmation of the beauty of life " , but i say it is a very dark and bleak statement about man's capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy .  the film's ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently , but i found it to be truly discerning and upsetting .  essentially , life is beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the history of film .  however , i am not denying the movie's greatness .  believe me , it's fantastic .  i'm just saying that i think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as .  but perhaps i'm reading more into the movie than is really there .  maybe the film's brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way they see fit .  in fact , maybe roberto benigni has made a film that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out of a movie exactly what you put into it .  
few films in 1999 have divided the critical consensus as sharply as alan parker's adaptation of frank mccourt's memoir angela's ashes .  many dismissed it as an humorless , sentimentalized , uninteresting version of the hugely popular novel ; others hailed it as a heartfelt , sincere portrait of the human spirit .  i'm somewhere in between , leaning strongly towards the latter .  it's certainly well-made and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be .  but i have a feeling that parker filled the movie with pseudo-lyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of ireland just so it can have the two-and-a-half hour running time that screams " i'm important ! "  mccourt's book of the same name was about him and his family moving from the us to ireland in the early 1900's , a time when most people were desperately trying to get into the us .  as he comments , " we were the only irishfolk to say goodbye to the statue of liberty . "  in ireland , frank ( played by joe breen as a small child ) , his 3 brothers , his mother angela ( emily watson ) and his father malachy ( robert carlyle ) get financial help from angela's mother , a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a northern irishman .  she helps them get a rat-infested apartment and malachy goes looking for a job .  positions are scarce and when he does finally find one , he is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking .  meanwhile , frank goes to an uptight catholic school , where the instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires .  two of frank's brothers soon die , crippled by the dreadful living conditions and malnutrition .  as if the poverty and the suffering weren't intense enough as it stood , malachy and angela have another baby , worsening the situation further .  i imagine this doesn't sound like much of a plot .  that's probably because it isn't one .  these are people .  this is their story .  director alan parker ( the commitments ) knows how to tell a good story and angela's ashes , despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting .  though the film occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting , it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue .  supplementing parker's able direction are the engaging , often poignant performances of the leads , some of them seasoned thespians , others relative beginners .  carlyle , the charismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy to the villain in a james bond movie and now to sentimental melodrama , perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character .  we empathize with the guy , but we don't like or admire him .  emily watson turns in a heartfelt , sincere supporting performance .  it is mostly she who implants that lump in our throats .  also worthy of mention is little joe breen , whose face graces the film's superb poster .  it is breen's first feature film and he's extraordinary as young frank .  not unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense , you can peer into the character's soul through breen's sad eyes .  on the flip side , one thing that could have vastly improved angela's ashes is a more decisive editor .  while gerry hambling sure makes the most of the scenery , he and parker also leave in at least a half an hour of unnecessary footage .  the first half , especially , could have been trimmed down , bringing the film to a more reasonable running time and doing our bladders a favor in the process .  things pick up at about the halfway point , sort of dismissing a lot of the criticisms i accumulated during the opening hour , but i maintain that the aggressively deliberate pace parker and co . set in the first half was ludicrously unnecessary .   * spoiler warning !  skip next paragraph if in suspense ! *  the film's final message is somewhat conflicted , as frankie , in effect , leaves his family famished in ireland while he himself goes back to america .  what , exactly , are we supposed to make of that ?  his mother doesn't seem to mind because she wants the best possible future for her son , as any mother would , but it still seems inconsiderate of him .  i haven't read the book , but i'm sure that mccourt justifies his actions therein ; therefore , i'm suspicious .  another thing that's never made clear in the movie is the meaning of the title , which , i'm sure , is also explained in the memoir .  if seen as a film onto itself , rather than an adaptation , angela's ashes stands tall .  despite a few minor setbacks , it is a captivating story of people forced to live in the trenches by an merciless society where those of weaker character are shoved to the bottom of the financial ladder .  
you've got mail is a timely romance for this impersonal , computer-driven decade .  two people who've never met confide in each other via e-mail without revealing their true identities .  nora ephron's contemporary update of the shop around the corner retains the basic plot : two people who despise each other unwittingly become enamored with each other through their anonymous correspondence .  ephron , who co-wrote the film with her sister , delia , as well as directed it , knew what she was doing by reteaming tom hanks and meg ryan as the at-odds couple .  ryan is kathleen kelly , owner of a small children's bookstore , while hanks is joe fox , who heads up a chain of mega bookstores ( think barnes & noble ) .  their charm and chemistry are the glue that binds this film , even through some of the script's rough spots .  for the ephrons invested so much effort in their protagonists that they give short shrift to the talented supporting cast , including parker posey , greg kinnear , jean stapleton and steve zahn .  yet no one is really going to complain because the ephrons know their audience - and what the paying public wants is hanks and ryan .  and the two are kept busy .  one , the other or both are in nearly every scene .  hanks has his decent guy routine down pat , yet each time he does it , it seems effortless , spontaneous and fresh .  ryan smoothly moves between spunky and vulnerable , with a sexy touch of winsomeness added to the brew .  their scenes together sparkle , even though they lack the nostalgic romanticism of sleepless in seattle .  and the shadow of that earlier hit hangs over you've got mail like dried-up mistletoe .  the sparks created by the earlier movie are , by necessity , not evident here .  true , these are two people seeking true love , but you've got mail is more comic and less poignant than its predecessor .  the ephrons' script is witty and sharp .  however , as a director nora ephron is a bit uneven .  some scenes drag , while others , especially when hanks and ryan are revealing their souls via e-mail , are crisp and tidy .  also , the script gets sloppy toward the end with characters merely disappearing from the story .  a nice , romantic soundtrack adds to this date-night special .  overall , you've got mail is a lush and cute outing , taking advantage of the star appeal of its two leads .  it's a nice holiday movie , one for holding hands and snuggling .  committed to lifelong learning through effective communication  
 " the end of the affair " is a dark and moody romantic period piece , that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs .  although it's slow and sometimes confusing to follow , it still manages to give audiences a moving experience .  based on graham greene's novel of the same name , the film mainly follows 3 characters .  there's maurice bendrix ( ralph fiennes ) who has an affair with henry mile's ( stephen rea ) wife sarah ( julianne moore ) .  sarah finds henry to be a bore , because well , he's just a normal guy .  it's all work and no play with him .  while maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah , and would do anything for her .  unfortunately the two break up .  this is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks , so that leads us to the present .  it's a few years later , and they both still think of each other , so maurice hires a private detective ( ian hart ) to see what sarah is up too .  while this may sound straight forward it's not .  it's a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men , unhappiness , and the ever lasting love .  all this may sound like a drag , but it really captures your interest .  with great performances by ralph fiennes ( doing another english patient type of film , only this movie is better ) and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all 5 films she did in 1999 , i believe this was the role , she had the most passion for , and you can see why .  the story was also well written thanks to neil jordan .  even though i didn't read the book , there's no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive .  what's so moving about it you ask ?  the tragedy of it all .  it's not the typical romance , in which a guy finds a girl , they fall in love and all is well , this is more complicated and depressing .  it really shows the complexity of a relationship , because nothing is ever perfect .  everyone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces .  back to neil jordan's script , it wasn't only red roses .  there were times when i felt it too be a little slow , but most romances are .  it also tended to be a bit confusing , especially at the start .  it keep jumping around from past to present , so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things .  also a notable was the superb direction by neil jordan .  i'd have to say this is his finest achievement to date , because quite frankly i've never really found his work to be up to par .  it just never did anything for me , until now .  when it ends , it leaves viewers a little saddened , but provoked nonetheless .  this is definitely one of the best films of 99 , and had some of the best acting , most notably by moore .  not for all movie goers , but for those who are film buffs and want something of value .  
in the wake of the smashing success of " rumble in the bronx , " it's looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release .  rumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii .  the version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; it's widescreen and bilingually-subtitled , as are most hong kong films these days .  availability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng .  the subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small .  although the american release will almost certainly be dubbed , this review is of the subtitled version , so please keep that in mind if you're reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it .  to be fair , i must admit that i've never been very fond of " period-piece " martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past .  perhaps it's because most of those i've seen were filmed on inferior stock , with either butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling , or perhaps it's because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and , in many cases , all but nonexistant .  in fact , many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end .  or , for that matter , it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god , rumble in the bronx , etc . ) tend to have more spectacular stunts , often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions , whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts .  having said that , i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above , is one of the better martial arts films i've seen , and i quite enjoyed it .  surprised ?  well , so was i .  drunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu .  where he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei-ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei-hong's practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu .  apparently , fei-hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i've heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i'll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better .  one of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the " once upon a time in china " movies , but i have not yet seen those .  the plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you're watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren't expecting something on the order of " war and peace " .  the story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china's cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill .  however , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film--fei-hong's perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs .  the macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners .  in the beginning , fei-hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically-wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer .  in the process , he clashes with another thief , who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng .  after fei-hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners' lackies , thanks to some timely intervention by a general's son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau , who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! ) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng .  and so it goes .  and the plot thickens later on , such as when fei-hong's girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei-hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition ) , but i think i've already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves .  let's move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies . . . the  action .  there's plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie . . . of  course , in a kung fu film , that's to be expected .  however , this isn't just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius .  the primary martial arts " style " featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk .  further , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated . . . but  there's a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor .  under normal circumstances , the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid , but jackie pulls it off with flair .  the kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i'll just say that the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in themselves make the movie worth watching .  another thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work .  even without motor vehicles ( well , not counting a train ) , there are some remarkable stunts in this film .  among other things , jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once , but at _least_ twice , if you count the outtake shown during the credits ) .   ( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . )  unlike in american films , these stunts are _not_ faked .  drunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene , including jackie , ti lung ( " a better tomorrow " 1 & 2 ) , and anita mui ( the " heroic trio " series , " rumble in the bronx " ) .  the performances are first-rate , especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film .  the scene where fei-hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei-hong's father's back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious , as is the scene where fei-hong's mother , having just revealed that she is pregnant , is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husband's anger away from fei-hong ) .  jackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years , and he's in fine form all through drunken master ii .  as far as cinematography is concerned , it certainly works for this film .  it's nothing spectacular , but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s .  the picture is crisp and clear .  one thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that , at least in the copy i have , the screen was wider than any film i've ever seen on videotape before--almost a whole 1/3 of the screen was blocked out above and below .   ( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . )  it will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan-and-scanned for american video release .  drunken master ii shows the full potential of " period piece " kung fu movies , and it's good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies .  the plot does meander a bit , but that's to be expected in this type of film .  if you like this kind of movie , you'll love this movie , and if not , well , give it a chance anyway .  if nothing else , the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental .  
plot : a bunch of bad guys dressed up as elvis impersonators rob a vegas casino during a presley convention .  the boys eventually get together to split the money , but as plans change , double-crosses occur , dealing and wheeling goes down and the crew set up for the road .  who's on the up and up , who's the real bad guy and who's gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie .  critique : the funnest movie that i've seen so far this year !  it's got style , it's got tough guys talkin' shite and it's got plenty of bullets to go around .  a definite hunk-a-hunk-a burnin' adventure !  a guy's guy movie through and through , and one that'll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff .  it's not very original , it goes on for a little too long , but costner and russell make it happen , as two shite-kickin' elvis lovers , who don't stop till they , more or less , drop .  this movie's got some pretty intensive shoot-out scenes , one of the coolest robbery scenarios that i've ever witnessed , featuring several elvises with guns a blazin' and the king's music playing in the background , and a decent helping of double-crosses , sharp dialogue and funny moments .  in fact , even though the cast is filled with many name actors ( b-actors as they might be for the most part ) , most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim .  but the true glue that holds this film together , other than the spirit of elvis himself , is costner and russell , who play their badass characters to the t . sure , russell's been down this road before , but costner surprised me with his nastiness .  i guess he's pissed at all the box-office bombs that he's been in of late , but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here .  in the end , the bottom line with this movie is having fun , kickin' ass and making sure there's enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards .  and smoke 'em if you got 'em , folks !  there is also this one really great show-down scene between costner and a cop , that'll have you crackin' up and lovin' it all at the same time .  the violent scenes in this movie are violent and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack that'll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next .  it should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background , with plenty , and i mean plenty , of camera tricks , cuts and edits , but for this kind of flick , it actually works .  the film is not perfect though , it starts off with a pretty big bang , but then pulls a way of the gun on us , and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle , while characters intermingle and disperse .  i was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots , and enjoyed the overall ride for what it was as well .  and did i mention that courteney cox looked mega-hot in the movie ?  no . . . okay ,  well i just did !  i coulda done without her whole " romance " angle , but to be honest , it doesn't take up much of the film , which is generally covered in blood , explosions , guts and elvis nods .  try to see how many " inside " connections to the king you can guess .  of course , it's no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind .  i also like these types of " guy " movies a lot , and even though the film doesn't bring much originality to the table , it does offer a pretty coherent story , some nice twists and turns , humor and a big ol' helping of whoop-ass coming straight from costner and russell's respective boots .  probably not a film for everyone , but definitely for those who enjoy the guns , the charismatic bad guys and a fun , if entirely disposable , adventure .  now see how many elvis songs i've used to pun my way through this phony review below .  the elvis songs also recommend this movie !  so whether you're lonesome tonight or any other night , remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets , leave your little sister at home , bring your bossa nova baby and rock out of that jailhouse , cause this movie ain't one to return to the sender .  i really beg of you , whether you're stuck in the ghetto or crying in the chapel , to slap this cinematic ring around your neck and love it tender .  and no suspicious minds either , folks , cause i got stung by this movie , i mean it really shook me up , and unless you're the devil in disguise himself , i think you won't be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either .  so don't be cruel , don't turn away , don't curl up with your latest flame tonite ( whether she be a hard-headed woman or not ) and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film .  it's now or never , folks .  trust me , i did it my way and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that i'd seen so far this year is far behind me .  joblo has now officially left the sanity of his mind and this building .  thank you . . . thank  you very much ! !  where's joblo coming from ?  get carter ( 7/10 ) - heat ( 8/10 ) - honeymoon in vegas ( 9/10 ) - payback ( 8/10 ) - reindeer games ( 5/10 ) -reservoir dogs ( 9/10 ) - way of the gun ( 6/10 )  
bruce willis is a type-casted actor .  in die hard , he played john mcclaine , a rough and tough chicago cop who gets caught in the wrong place at the wrong time .  again , in pulp fiction , as butch coolidge , an over-the-hill boxer , he steps on the wrong guys toes .  in luc besson's the fifth element , willis plays korben dallas , a new york cabby who takes in the wrong passenger at the worst possible time .  a stylish science fiction epic , the fifth element's complex plot begins right away , in the deserts of egypt ( think stargate ) in 1914 .  an enormous spacecraft lands above a pyramid where the " 5 elements " are stored and takes them away , vowing to return them when the evil comes back .  cut to present day , which is our future .  the year is 2023 , and new york is the city .  the only basic differences between besson's futuristic depiction and the real life new york is that the smog is thicker , the buildings are higher , and the traffic floats !  anyway , the " evil " comes back as a ball of fire to wreak havoc on the fair citizens of the earth , so back come the tortoise-like aliens to return the " 5 elements " to earth , in order to defend themselves against the " evil . "  in the process , however , the ship is intercepted by 2 fighter pods and is destroyed before landing .  when officials arrive at the site , all that remains is a hand .  what can you do with a hand ?  hey , its the 21st century here-dna reconstruction !  this hand turns out to belong to a beautiful , but mysterious woman named leeloo ( milla jovovich , dazed and confused ) .  she escapes and , attempting to escape the police by swan diving off of an enormous skyscraper and crashing through the roof of korben's floating cab .  it's love at first site , as korben and leeloo elude the lazy-as-always cops .  when leeloo begins mumbling about a cornelius ( ian holm , night falls on manhattan ) , korben searches the " yellow pages " and delivers her to the door of the good reverend , the only man who knows of her background and duties .  now , korben , leeloo , and cornelius must journey to a foreign planet to board a cruise ship ( special effects were spectacular here ) to find the remaining four elements .  it is here , where they discover that they have been followed by the evil jean-baptiste emmanuel zorg ( gary oldman , murder in the first ) .  he , too , wants possession of the elements , as do a group of pig-like warriors ( think the gamorreans in return of the jedi ) .  in a spectacular ending , with time running out , leeloo is faced with a problem-why should she save a people who live to destroy each other ?  the question is a good one , and one that could be pondered .  but enough of that .  when korben points out his love for her , leeloo is inclined to become the " 5th element " and save the world from total destruction .  the fifth element features good performances by willis and holm , an excellent portrayal of a comedic villain ( who reminded me a lot of jack nicholson's the joker in batman ) by one of the masters of villainy , oldman , and a heartfelt offering by relative newcomer jovovich .  the supporting cast , which includes brion james ( tango & cash ) , tim " tiny " lester ( no holds barred ) , luke perry ( buffy the vampire slayer ) , and chris tucker ( friday ) , added a comedic effect to the film .  although besson's the fifth element can be criticized for the outlandish use of cliches , it is a solid motion picture with a definite point .  some other directors ( like anaconda's luis llosa ) should take a lesson from this guy-using ideas from epic motion pictures the right way .  ideas from star wars and stargate were utilized for the improvement of this film .  sci-fi fan or not , any movie-lover should see this wonderfully stylish motion picture .   ,  
sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film .  sometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride .  i saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers , most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes .  surprised , they may have been , when they realized that this picture actually had something to say .  but by the attentiveness of the crowd i'd say they were won over - as was i . i can't tell yet if truman really is that good , or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year .  time alone will make that call .  but by the end of the film we were all on truman burbank's side .  we were concerned for his well-being , and wanted him to win .  that we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey , who has achieved legitimacy at last .  the truman show is a film best viewed cold , with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot .  unless you're under a media blackout , however , you probably know the basics .  carrey stars as truman burbank , a capra-esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl ( laura linney ) in the south florida island town of seahaven , which looks like michael eisner's idea of the perfect american small town .  truman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle , complete with a working wife , a best bud , friendly neighbors and interesting co-workers .  there is tragedy in his past - his father drowned in a horrible boating accident , leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water , and of travel in general - but overall , life is good .  but then one day as truman leaves his house for work , a klieg light falls magically from the sky .  this curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows : that he is a prisoner on the world's biggest soundstage , that his wife , friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him , and that his life has , for over 10 , 000 days , been broadcast as the world's most popular television program .  what makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir .  the soundstage , we're told , is " only the second man-made structure visible from space . "  truman's movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5 , 000 cameras scattered throughout the town : button cams , dashboard cams , mirror cams , wife cams , big cams and small cams .  weir cuts the film so we're never quite sure if we're watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of the show's omnipotent creator christof ( ed harris ) who oversees the show from a control room built into the man-made moon in seahaven's sky .  the second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence .  his best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) always has a six pack of beer with him .  his wife seems to exist in an eternal commercial in which she is always endorsing the latest hot household product .  he sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town .  one wonders why he didn't pick up on any of this earlier , but christof has an answer for this : " people tend to accept the reality with which they're presented . "  nevertheless , truman begins to grow restless , and dreams of escape to fiji , where an old college sweetheart ( natasha mcelhone ) supposedly lives .  this convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a magical and provocative concept ; the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way .  by underplaying truman , he allows the subtle manipulations of the film to take over .  there is a particularly poignant scene in which truman confides his fears to marlon , and marlon answers with best-friend sincerity , " i'd gladly step in front of a bus for you . "  but that line was fed to marlon through an earpiece by christof .  the abject cruelty to which truman is subjected to hits home - and from that moment , we're on his side .  the truman show derives much of its success from playing to our own secret paranoid fantasies - haven't we all , at least once , doubted our place in the world , doubted the sincerity of those closest to us ?  ultimately , however , the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator .  what does god really think of us ?  does he resent our abandonment of paradise ?  who exactly is watching us , up there in the sky ?  if you enjoy the picture as much as i did , credit weir for allowing the magic of the screenplay to work .  as for carrey - well , truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play .  carrey is no jimmy stewart ; to his credit , he doesn't try to be .  he just tries to feel the way you or i would , if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us .  
just look back two years ago at the coen brothers' comedic gem the big lebowski , change the actors , take away the bowling alley , add a record store , and you've got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby's novel high fidelity came first ) .  either way , it's been done before , a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances , yet it remains consistently funny .  why is this ?  maybe because you know your life is much better than this , you know these guys are more pathetic than you are , and you know its ok to laugh at them because they're fictional .  director stephen frears , possibly not intentionally , has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day .  when watching high fidelity , expect to laugh at someone else's pain , realize what you are laughing at , and then laugh again .  i laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) , the shy , timorous , steve buscemi character of lebowski , who seems to know what he is talking about but either can't put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends .  i laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black ) , an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons , pudgy , egotistic , and obnoxious at the same time .  and i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) , the jeff bridges type , whom the story revolves around .  rob is the character easiest to relate to , but he is nothing like you at all .  he uncontrollably cheats and lies , then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman .  and like his other miserable friends , pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort .  he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it .  whatever human emotions the clash , aretha franklin , and bruce springsteen records hold , rob and co .  grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives .  rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in .  during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on , rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him .  but these aren't any girlfriends ? these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( rob's incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life ) .  the plot in three words is : women and music .  the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective .  it gives high fidelity a quickly paced , informal structure , adjectives which perfectly parallel rob's own lifestyle .  it also helps open the viewer's eyes as to how annoying barry is .  jack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball .  just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob , who must work with him every day of the week .  what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes .  john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast , consisting of big stars and character actors , that really defines rob .  now instead of rob just talking to the camera , after he explains something , the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say .  the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn't end when it should have ended .  instead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that .  also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie .  high fidelity is a cheerful , old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs .  i just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen , they make everyone look and feel great .  
in 1912 , a ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america .  this ship was built to be the largest ship in the world , and she was .  she was also build to be one of the most luxurious , and that she was .  finally , she was built to be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not .  to get a ticket for this voyage you either : spent a life's savings to get to america to start life anew , were part of the upper class and had the money to spare , or finally were lucky enough to have a full house in a poker match by the docks like jack dawson .  jack dawson makes the trip , and happens to be at the right place at the right time .  rose dewitt bukater , a first class passenger , climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping .  thus is started a tale of romance and intrigue , and a tale of death and tragedy . . .  this movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago , an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia .  the movie titanic shows what happened , maybe not with a 100% degree of accuracy , but it still shows it very realisticaly .  now the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story .  it serves as both admirably , brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating .  this movie is very emotional simply because of what it is , but that alone is not enough .  the story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective .  movies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency .  the attention to detail that was paid is remarkable .  the whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting , with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie .  part of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting , and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast .  the performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired .  the characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles .  looking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they aren't acting but are actually the characters in the movie .  the casting for the movie could really have been better , in my humble opinion that is .  one character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself .  yes , you read correctly , the ship is a character .  how is the titanic a character ?  you ask well simple , a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you .  this character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this .  mr . cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense .  all this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp .  now , to produce the effect that i mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards .  the effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking .  in some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there , you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening ( if your imagination is good ) .  the technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique .  the movie will leave you amazed at the effects , and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie , just humans and an oversized ship .  the movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions , the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes .  now that is not a feat accomplished by most movies , now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch , i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end .  the historical value of this movie is quite high , and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy , for it is extremely well done .  the method of telling the story is also good , maybe not totally unique but effective none the less .  regardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at .  the simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing .  if you get the chance to see this movie go ! ! !  it might not be the best movie in the world . .  but it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it .  during none of the 3 hours and 13 minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie .  
veteran actor clint eastwood has never looked as grizzled as he does in true crime , his latest directorial effort .  when steve everett ( his newest character ) gets angry at someone , he glares them down with those famous dirty harry eyes , furrows his brow and frowns like a grizzly bear who's just lost his cubs .  eastwood has played some particularly despicable characters in his time , but everett could just take the cake .  he gets my vote , at least , partly because `ev' is a drunken affair-a-week womanizer who has many relationship problems , very few of which are with his wife ( diane venora ) .  when his colleague at the oakland tribune is in an ugly car wreck and dies , everett must take over for her at a vital interview session .  the interview is with frank beacham ( isaiah washington ) , a death-row inmate set to die at midnight for the murder of a pregnant convenience store clerk .  eastwood furrows his brow .  as everett gradually finds information , he realizes that beacham could very well be innocent .  he interviews a key witness ( michael jeter ) , who claims that he burst in the door at pocum's foods because his car had overheated , only to see beacham standing over the dead woman's body , blood on his suspenders , gun in hand .  but everett protests : how could he have seen the gun , which was lowered by his side , with the potato chip rack in front of him ?  jeter doesn't know what he's talking about .  eastwood furrows his brow .  crinkled expressions and all , clint is the centre of energy of true crime .  the film is by no means a standard action/suspense yarn , but a thoughtful human story in which the characters come before the shoot-outs .  isaiah washington has a break-out performance as frank beacham , and scenes with him and his weary wife ( lisa gay hamilton ) are truly heartfelt moments .  but the best scenes are ones that feature eastwood duking it out with those in authority over him .  denis leary , as everett's editor and boss , has more than a few memorable moments of restrained anger ( you see , ev is sleeping with his wife ) .  but hands down , the most enjoyable segments of the film are when james woods is on camera .  playing the big boss alan mann , woods and eastwood create amusing chemistry and laugh-out-loud punchlines .  when true crime opts for a high-speed chase to the governer's house at the finale , the quality of film-making takes an abrupt nosedive .  eastwood was so successful with colorful character portraits that he didn't need to switch lanes .  true crime is a tension-building , intriguing drama showcase for the talented director and star .  this is a road block he could have easily dismissed ( i furrow my brow ) .   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
imagine this .  you're given a sword and a shield and very basic , minimal training .  a man you don't know tells you that this will be the last day that you will live .  you are thrown into an arena with thousands of spectators wanting to see you die .  you frantically monitor several closed doors which , in seconds , will release vicious enemies prepared to destroy you .  you watch as the innocent friends you made in the last few days are murdered in cold blood .  if you are lucky enough to survive this chaos thrown at you , you know you're going to have to do it all over again tomorrow .  eventually know matter how strong or skilled you are , you're going to die .  this is the life of a gladiator .  you'll never have to be a gladiator and after seeing ridley scott's powerful gladiator , you'll be thankful for that .  with his new film , scott has returned cinema to the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire .  and like those preceding it , spartacus and ben hur , gladiator has nearly everything going for it - a strong lead actor , a wonderful supporting cast , eye-catching special effects , and a great script .  since the two aforementioned films came out before the prime target viewers of gladiator ( teenagers to thirty-year-old males ) were around , a whole new genre may just be reborn and revisited .  >from a weak beginning , the film starts off extremely gloomy and inauspicious .  rome's best general maximus ( russell crowe ) , who has helped the empire conquer nearly everywhere they have attempted , is currently ( in the year 180 a . d . that is ) waging a war against germania .  scott shoots the gory battle in an awkward style , similar to that of saving private ryan but much less effective .  it's blurry , in slow motion , and the sound is muted .  as soon as this artistic method began , it was hard to tell what was what and who was who .  it's a good thing scott stops this after the first twenty minutes or else gladiator would have been torture to watch .  instead , the general swears he will get out after this battle .  he wants to go back to his family and his crops , he wants a quiet life .  but , unexpectedly , he gets anything but that .  the dying emperor of rome , marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , decides to have maximus appointed new emperor of rome once he dies .  he asks maximus to restore the republic by giving more power to the senators .  all of this does not go well for aurelius' son , commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) who was expecting his father to name him the new emperor .  jealous and upset , commodus kills his own father , names himself emperor , kills maximus' wife and son , and attempts to kill maximus .  but maximus is able to escape his own death and vows to kill commodus and fulfill marcus aurelius' wishes .  now a slave , the only way he can win his own freedom and complete his goal is to become a winning gladiator , who eventually are released for their success .  a story of betrayal and promises , gladiator is more than just a mindless action flick .  you actually care about the characters , sometimes even the evil villain commodus , who is just a young man as determined to make rome one way as maximus is determined to make it the other way .  phoenix plays his character brilliantly .  think of commodus as the percy wetmore ( of pant-wetter the green mile ) of the roman empire - a whiny , sleazy , " respect-me-because-my-father-was-a-good-man " brat who hates when he's not the center of attention .  every scene we see commodus , he's either crying or he looks like he has just been crying .  phoenix has definitely matured as an actor since to die for , and gladiator shows he's more than just river's little brother .  crowe is also excellent as the film's grisly-faced hero .  maximus is one of the few characters in recent cinema who actually has emotions .  this guy actually acts like a anyone in his situation would act , he's no invincible superhero who only blurts out one-liners , he ( believe it or not ) acts like a human being !  the rest of the cast , including richard harris , djimon hounsou , walter hill , derek jacobi , and connie nielsen are also first rate .  ridley scott , using outstanding special effects , has brilliantly recreated the roman coliseum , the loudness of the roman mob , and the city of rome in general .  the visuals are breathtaking and voluminous , like a cleopatra of the year 2000 .  the costuming is also wonderful from the detailed shields and armor to the exquisite dress of the upper-class politicians .  gladiator is another movie you have to see on the big screen to get the most out of the experience .  along with u-571 , action fans should have plenty to see in theaters this week and should expect much more excitement to come this summer of 2000 .  
i have seen several ( but not that many ) woody allen movies .  i didn't particulary like radio days , the purple rose of cairo , play it again , sam .  i quite enjoyed manhatten murder mystery and everything . . .  sex , and i loved might aphrodite .  however i found bullets over broadway to be a snoozing bore .  and bullets got some very raving reviews , but i didn't think i'd like .  but i finally saw it ( double feature with ready to wear i think ) and hated it .  since . . .  i love you also seems to be getting raving reviews i wasn't sure if i'd want to see . . .  thankfully i did !  people burst into singing and dancing , something i hardly ever like .  but this movie is so infectious .  and funny !  and entertaining !   ( and unlike evita , they only sing when they need to . )  sure some of the actors may not be great singers , but they seems to be having a great time , and so does the audience .  that's all i have to say .  really , if you think that is going to be a dull movie , you're probably dead .  and dead people should not be forced into movie theatres .  is mark leeper dead ?  he said that " this is an almost ghastly misfire " .  the movie is rated r , for * one * use of the word motherf * * * * * .  
there's an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last .  george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy .  return of the jedi , the final installment of the series , is easily the most innovative , action-packed , and entertaining of the three films .  the dark , eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone .  instead , for return of the jedi , we have good triumphing decisively over evil , a resolution to a love triangle , and walking teddy bears .  even darth vader doesn't seem very intimidating this time around .  with the arrival of the emperor ( an apparition-like creature played by ian mcdiarmid ) , vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman .  return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back .  luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , lando calrissian , ( billy dee williams ) , chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) , c3p0 ( anthony daniels ) and r2-d2 ( kenny baker ) are on a rescue mission to luke's home planet of tatooine .  their goal : to save han solo ( harrison ford ) from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt .  it is at jabba's home , a creepy-looking stone fortress guarded by hog-nosed beasts , that most of the added special effects come into play .  from a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba's sand barge , the effects are top notch .  as soon as han is freed from his cryo-freeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt , it's back to outer space , where the rebel alliance is about to face the empire's newest threat : a second , more powerful death star , that , if activated , could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor .  so , while the fleet prepares for the final battle , luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks .  there , they are befriended by the ewoks , the teddy bear-like native race , and luke , fearing that his presence is endangering the group , turns himself over to vader .  return of the jedi has some interesting elements .  the scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and well-acted .  from a technical point-of-view , the space battles are amazing , easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films .  not only are there many , many more ships , but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved .  on one level , return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects .  in the special edition , even more ships are added , making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch .  the acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films .  by now ( or then - 1983 ) , mark hamill , harrison ford , and carrie fisher have all matured in their on-screen personas .  the chemistry amongst the trio is terrific .  as in empire , billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for .  newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy , cunning , and evil creature , although he's not as imposing as vader was in star wars .  although it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen , return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment .  with the spectacular , new special effects , the adorable ewoks , the sinister jabba the hutt , the evil emperor , the same old millenium falcon , darth vader's incredible betrayal , the destruction of the new death star , and the always lovable yoda , return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang .  congratulations to george lucas , whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come .   ,  
plot : odin is a great high school basketball player .  he's dating a hot girl and the coach loves his ass .  in fact , the coach even admits to having fatherly feelings towards him .  unfortunately , the coach's real son , hugo , isn't too pleased to hear that .  in fact , he doesn't like hearing about any of odin's triumphs , as they generally supersede his own .  so what does he set out to do ?  well , let's just say that he starts to mess with people's heads and one thing leads to another thing which leads to . . . well ,  you'll see .  critique : a very powerful , thoroughly depressing , well-acted " non-teen " movie starring a bunch of teens .  credit director tim blake nelson for creating a modern day version of this shakespearian classic , set in a realistic high school environment , with the basketball championships as the backdrop and an impending sense of doom as it core .  you also have to give it up to all of the actors in this film , who turn over some very convincing performances , taking you through all of their characters' ups and downs .  hartnett especially should be applauded for taking on such a despicable character , a dude who you just want to grab by the throat and beat the shit out of ( sign of a good actor , if you ask me ) .  phifer also comes to play in this movie , with a nice blend of charisma , fear , love and anger spread over his character .  i was always on this guy's side and definitely felt sorry for him as things moved along .  julia stiles was also good , but her character wasn't much different from others that she's played recently .  i was however very surprised with martin sheen's showing , since i hadn't taken him too seriously as an actor over the past few years .  his character is definitely over-the-top in this film , but i appreciated his fervor , his rage , his ultimate and blind desire to win above all .  a great example of a workaholic man who cannot see the trees from the forest .  i did have a few reservations about the movie though .  first of all , what was with all of the gangsta hip-hop music used in pretty much every other scene transition ?  it was cute at first , but became a little too obvious and annoying after a few times .  the film was also edited pretty choppily . . . like  some scenes were cut out and no one " cleaned it up " afterwards .  i also didn't like the fact that hartnett's character , the man behind much of the nastiness that goes down in this film , was infallible .  in other words , pretty much everything he says or asks of someone , happens automatically and without any goofups .  i mean , i know the guy is smart and all , but i would have appreciated a little more " realism " under some of the circumstances .  but overall , the movie will devastate you .  it's not a " fun date movie " .  it's not a movie about the high school basketball team and how its black star falls for the white girl from the other side of the tracks .  it's about jealousy , love , envy , fury , passion , revenge and pretty much any other negative thought that's ever passed through your head .  is it worth seeing ?  oh , most definitely !   ( pun intended ) it's a moving picture with great performances , no shakespearian speak ( thank you , god ! ) and an outstanding directorial job by nelson .  the final scene alone is enough to send a massive chill down your spine , and i was especially impressed with the director's choice of music near the end .  in fact , the whole sequence was quite reminiscent of the final showdown scene from taxi driver , and i guess that's saying something right there .  where's joblo coming from ?  10 things i hate about you ( 7/10 ) - election ( 7/10 ) - hamlet ( 6/10 ) - love's labor's lost ( 8/10 ) - natural born killers ( 9/10 ) - save the last dance ( 7/10 ) - shakespeare in love ( 5/10 )  
in recent years , harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence , scowling through the likes of tom clancy's jack ryan series , _the_fugitive_ , and last year's smash _air_force_one_ , that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained from his system .  apparently , it was just lying dormant .  with ivan reitman's enjoyable romantic comedy/adventure _six_days , _seven_nights_ , the lovable scoundrel is back , giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons .  ford plays quinn harris , a carefree and slightly slobby ( endearingly so ) pilot in the tropics whose broken-down plane crashes in a storm , stranding him and his charter , new york magazine editor robin monroe ( anne heche ) , on a deserted island .  of course , the sophisticated robin and the salt-of-the-earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down , and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their first meeting .  while some of the lines fall flat , the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford and heche .  both actors , who have largely done serious works as of late , seem liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders , and they deliver their zingers , as weak as they sometimes are , with beguiling abandon .  naturally , there's nothing like a life-threatening crisis to bring two people together , and quinn and robin's warmup to each other is sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates .  granted , some conflict needed to be introduced on the island , but this tacked-on development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes .  but the point is to get the two together , and their newfound affection causes complications for both , but mostly robin , who came to the islands on a vacation with her fiance frank ( david schwimmer ) , who frantically awaits her return on the home island .  reitman , and old , reliable hand at breezy comedies , keeps the pace brisk and capably handles the more action-oriented sequences .  his big accomplishment , however , is bringing the old , smiling ford back .  as appealing and charismatic as he always is , ford hasn't been quite this charming and affable in years ; he's obviously having a blast , and the audience cannot help but have one along with him .  holding her own is heche , whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she initially promises to be ( as the plane goes down , she frantically pops stress pills ) .  she can take her lumps , physical and otherwise , just as well as quinn , making her a formidable foil and ideal match .  formulaic and light as a feather , _six_days , _seven_nights_ could be cited as a classic example of the summer " popcorn " movie season's lack of substance .  it's certainly fluff , but it's unpretentious , undemanding , and--most importantly--fun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina colada on a balmy tropical beach .  pass the popcorn .  
one of the funniest carry on movies and the third with a medical setting .  the main story is about dr . james nookey ( jim dale ) who is disliked by his superiors , frederick carver , head of the hospital ( kenneth williams ) , and dr . ernest stoppidge ( charles hawtrey ) who seems to dislike everyone .  they attempt to cause him as much trouble in the hospital as possible and all the blame is laid on nookey .  carver learns of a possible job opportunity from wealthy ellen moore ( joan sims ) on a distant tropical island and gets nookey trannsferred there .  when nookey arrives at this island , he meets gladstone screwer ( sid james ) who has lived on the island just about all his life .  screwer is in possession of a wonderful slimming drug made from natural ingredients .  dr . nookey returns with the drug to england and sets up a new slimming business with ellen moore's financial backing .  however , nookey and moore face opposition from screwer who goes to england to cash in on the drug , and carver and stoppidge who want to know the ingredients to create a rival drug .  the performances are all very commendable .  sid james has a slightly ambiguous character to play this time and he excels in his role .  kenneth williams , as usual , plays the unpopular and cunning head of the hospital .  joan sims is entertaining as the wealthy benefactor and jim dale should really head the cast with his excellent portrayal of bumbling nookey .  charles hawtrey plays an 'out-of-character' role as dr . stoppidge , the nasty and evil practitioner who wants to knock nookey off his perch .  some critics have said that this combination of hawtrey and stoppidge does not work well , but i think that it at least gives hawtrey a new part to play instead of the usual dimwit characters .  as a matter of fact , hawtrey is suitably cunning in the part .  other regulars in the movie include hattie jacques as the matron yet again ( but this part is probably her most boring 'matron' ) and barbara windsor as nookey's love interest and unofficial 'women's lib' campaigner , goldie locks .  both jacques and windsor play their parts well .  patsy rowlands appears briefly as miss fosdick , and there are very small cameos from wilfrid brambell ( from 'steptoe and son' fame ) and peter butterworth .  the jokes are mostly very funny , the story is quite appealing , and the regulars seem interested in what they're doing .  although it is another medical carry on movie and some of the jokes are borrowed from previous movies , it still comes out on top ( it is the best medical carry on ) because of the above factors .  a must-see carry on movie .  
waiting at the train station near the beginning of fury , joe says : `after all , we're human . '  in the context of events to transpire , joe's line is prophetic , foreshadowing the internal conflict of the protagonist in the latter half of the film .  does being human necessarily imply humane behavior ?  through the baseness of human character exemplified in the formation of a mob , fritz lang prompts the viewer to consider whether our inclination towards impulsiveness supersedes our civility .  expressing his abhorrence towards the rise of nazism in his homeland , lang takes great care in creating a sense of discomfort during the scenes of mob hysteria .  in the scene prefacing the lynching , the mob achieves critical mass at the bar .  deputy meyers is brought in as an exalted informant , but when he is unable to augment the mob's myth of joe , he is quickly renounced from his position as town gossip .  we see in a shot where two bar patrons are arguing that the deputy looks around nervously at the growing monster and then carefully slips out of the bar .  what is quietly horrifying is the realization by both the audience and the deputy that the crowd no longer exists within the confines of reason and has succumbed to what the barber referred to as impulse .  what once was excitement to the deputy has turned into fear with the realization that he is now powerless .  to the audience , the deputy's quiet exit concurs with their own sinking feeling of uneasiness as the mob's delirium crescendos .  lang educes this discomfort not through movement of the camera , but rather its stillness .  the shot's composition places the audience equidistant and directly across from the pair of arguing patrons and the deputy effectively becomes a mirror to our own apprehensions .  as the intensity of the mob closes around deputy meyers , it does so around the viewer as well .  the stationary camera in this shot heightens our fears because when the deputy escapes , we are deserted by our reflection and the viewer becomes the sole proprietor of sensibility amongst a swarm of irrationality .  because the camera does not track the deputy's movement , we are left with an amplified perception of desertion and vulnerability .  as the bar scene progresses , the camera pans 180 degrees to reveal the fury of the mob .  this shot is unique because it is a point-of-view shot where the audience , not a character in the film is the subject .  while a long , or dolly shot may objectively reveal the size of the mob , panning from the mob's belly distorts the audience's spatial reference and exaggerates the claustrophobia of the scene ; we feel we are at the epicenter of something infinitely large .  we see close shots of people's faces , contorted by their rage .  with the pivot of the pan being in the center of the mob and angry members within a short radius of the pan , lang offers the viewer a sense of what it feels like to be the subject of a lynching .  in this shot the audience is at the mercy of the mob ; lang's camera makes us feel vulnerable and powerless as joe must have felt in the jail .  in some greater sense , it must have been what lang felt when he saw his countrymen overcome with unjustifiable hatred towards their own humankind .  lang's observations of his fellow man succumbing to mob behavior left him with an indelible image of malevolent human behavior .  as joe faces his peril , trapped in his burning cell , his dog rainbow rushes to be by his side .  lang makes rainbow a martyr to contrast his humanity against the recklessness of his human counterparts .  using his camera to create shots that elicit disturbing images of mob mentality , lang depicts man's volatility and `impulse' towards inconceivable cruelty .  reprising joe' s line at the train station , we are induced to question why our primeval impulses so easily transcend our humanity .  
don't let the following quirks of this review , fool you into believing that this movie is anything short of an ultimate labour of love .  but one can see the humour of roberto benigni when you see that ?  life is beautiful , even though i'm a short , ugly looking man with an obnoxious laugh .  life is beautiful even though i haven't amounted to much in life , except working out the finer intricacies of waitering .  i'm a lucky sort of a guy , especially when a beautiful woman strips away my venner of superficiality to find a new age , sensitive guy with the biggest heart in the entire world underneath - life is beautiful !  i'm a jew , but life can still be beautiful .  the nazis put me in a concentration camp , but life is still beautiful .  i love my son very much and that's what matters , and that's what makes life beautiful .  my ability to entertain somehow convinces my son that living in a concentration camp is somewhat beautiful ?  i get shot for my efforts and the woman i love , but hey that's life and that's still a beautiful thing - so by jove don't give me any crap about it !  by far the movie with the biggest heart this decade and well deserves every nomination and award that it has achieved .  well done , there should be more film directors and actors like you roberto benigni .  
the premise is simple , if not bizarre .  a mad scientist ( trace beaulieu as dr . clayton forrester ) launches an average-joe ( michael j . nelson as mike nelson ) into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made .  why ?  it's torturous , it's maniacal , and it's just plain fun .  based on the cult-favorite cable television series , mystery science theater 3000 : the movie isn't torturous , but as for being maniacal and just plain fun , it foots the bill quite nicely .  mike nelson , on a dog-bone shaped spacecraft , spends his days as any young man would dream - indulging in sarcasm and horseplay , and seeing quite a few movies .  the catch is , these movies aren't the movies he chooses , but retched examples of film-making chosen specifically by dr . forrester in an attempt to break mike's will to live .  dr . forrester is convinced that one too many b- movies is all it will take to ruin a man , but with a couple of wise-cracking puppet buddies ( tom servo , voiced by kevin murphy , and crow t . robot , voiced by beaulieu ) , the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema .  the purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known ( even if by very few of us ) to man .  we watch as the silhouettes of mike , tom , and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them .  in this case , it's the 1954 sci-fi film this island earth .  we basically watch as our three leads watch , only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary .  the plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant , but for the sake of those who might want to know , i'll explain this one .  this island earth is the tale of two scientists , a man and a woman , who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth .  together the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet .  to make mst3k work , the film-within-the-film naturally has to be as horrible as possible , and although the tv-series introduced us to several worse films than this island earth , it's a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty .  mst3k , which doesn't actually contain the complete this island earth , is a short 73 minutes , but this is a step very wisely taken .  as funny as some of their observations are , it can only go so long .  occasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously .  although it takes a second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment , it's better than overkilling the whole concept post haste .  mst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly , but if you don't know what you're in for , it could be a jarring disappointment .  although i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars , it is a movie to be seen on home video , late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway , and with a large , saracastic crowd - new year's at midnight for example , which is when i saw it .  warning : although mst3k has more to its end credits than most ( the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun ) , they are actually more annoying than most .  the name slandering and asinine one-liners were extremely unfunny , and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight , it put a heavy damper on the overall experience .  most people will likely stay to see what the smart-alec's have to say , but for me , it almost ruined an otherwise good film .  
all those who were offended by there's something about mary should not tread in the waters of american pie , a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch .  and while this uproariously funny , gross-out summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste , it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end .  american pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenage-targeted fare this season .  i must question the studio that releases a movie like this .  the producers are aiming these films at the 15-24 crowd , but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an r-rated film .  some have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc-17 , a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie .  american pie was threatened with an nc-17 , but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product , it was given an r . but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park .  it is sick , perverse , and ultimately disgusting - not to mention extremely funny .  american pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night .  jim ( jason biggs ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) , oz ( chris klein ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) are a quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead .  jim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base , to which one of his friends replies : `like warm apple pie . . . ' .  of course , this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers , in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner .  there are many moments , such as this , in which director paul weitz uses a game-plan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary : to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief .  american pie is a hard-fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it .  i loved the young cast in this movie .  consider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with , obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects , and you should appreciate their performances .  biggs is more than enjoyable , and chris klein ( who recently played a similar jock in election ) is obviously a young talent on the rise .  but in a teen-dominated movie , the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy ( of television's sctv ) , who is unexpectedly brilliant as jim's uneasy father .  scenes in which the familiar father-son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie .  after levy discovers jim's new use for apple pie , he tells him , `i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age .  but i never used baked goods . '  it is performances such as his , and bill murray's in rushmore , that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out .  there are some less-than-original aspects of the film .  a bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of ex-lax is something we've seen before .  if weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers , then this is a decidedly unwise move : the same prank was pulled in the brother's dumb and dumber , and used to greater effect .  secondly , the characters are forced into a half-hearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing .  but at one point , in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of it's own , biggs asks his buddies why he's going through so much pressure for something that's `not very important anyway . '  and so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate , it still manages to be mature .  in it's own way .  
the small-scale film , in limited release , " waking ned devine " is a pleasant excursion to a time and place which allows the audience to absorb the full texture of a small town .  filled with breathtaking scenery , 'characters' , and delightful music , the movie would be interesting even without a plot .  the story contains several surprises which are best left unmentioned in a review .  the film starts out with a sharp opening , which gives us a taste of what is to follow : country folk with an inclination for a bit of larceny .  what gets things going is the fact that a winner of the lottery is apparently one of the residents in the small town ( pop 52 ) of tullymore .  who that person is , and how to share in the good fortune is the mission of two longtime friends jackie ( ian bannen ) and michael ( david kelly ) .  part detectives , part scalawags , they have to stay alert to the changing circumstances they face as the story unfolds .  the village consists of several amusing characters .  a clueless pig farmer , temporary priest , and a witch .  there's also the lotto man who must be satisfied that everything is on the up-and-up .  there are no hollywood touches to this film - except for the outer space introduction [ ! ] .  pacing is right .  towards the end , it runs a bit out of steam , but that's okay because for most of the 90 minutes we've been interested in the goings on .  a mixture of laughs and ( occasional ) sentiment - all the right emotions are engaged .  in one brief dream sequence - you'll know it when you see it - a fantastic combination of color and music transports the characters to a place you really hope exists .  one of the key moments in the film .  the music , available on cd ( london 289 460 939-2 ) follows the same arc as the movie and is well worth considering .  a fine film that's for everybody except action fans .  somewhat like 'the englishman who went up a hill and came down a mountain , ' . . .  but livelier .  
capsule : side-splitting comedy that follows its own merciless logic almost through to the end . . .  but not without providing a good deal of genuine laughs .  most comedies these days have one flaw .  they're not funny .  they think they're funny , but they are devoid of anything really penetrating or dastardly .  occasionally a good funny movie sneaks past the deadening hollywood preconceptions of humor and we get a real gem : ruthless people , for instance , which established a microcosm of a setup and played it out to the bitter end .  liar liar is built the same way and is just about as funny .  this is one of the few movies i've seen where i was laughing consistently almost all the way through : instead of a couple of set-pieces that inspired a laugh ( think of the dismal fatal instinct ) , the whole movie works like clockwork .  jim carrey playes a high-powered lawyer , to whom lying is as natural as breathing .  there is one thing he takes seriously , though : his son , and we can sense the affection that they have for each other right away .  but his wife is divorced and seeing another man , and now it looks like they may move away together .  the son goes with them , of course .  the movie sets up this early material with good timing and a remarkable balance of jim carrey's over-the-top persona with reality .  then the plot springs into action : after being snubbed ( not deliberately ) by his father at his birthday , the kid makes a wish as he blows out the birthday candles : that for just one day , dad can't lie .  he gets the wish .  what happens next is sidesplitting .  everything turns into a confrontation : when cornered by a bum for some change , he shouts , " no !  i'm not giving you any money because i know you'll spend it on booze !  all i want to do is to get to the office without having to step over the debris of our decaying society ! "  he can't even get into an elevator without earning a black eye .  and what's worse , he's now gotten himself into an expensive divorce settlement that requires him to twist the truth like abstract wire sculpture .  carrey , who i used to find unfunny , has gotten better at his schtick , even if it's a limited one .  he uses it to great effect in this movie .  there is a scene where he tries to test his ability to lie and nearly demolishes his office in the process ( there's a grin breaking out across my face right now , just remembering the scene ) .  he can't even write the lie ; his fingers twitch , his body buckles like someone in the throes of cyanide poisoning , and when he tries to talk it's like he's speaking in tongues .  equally funny is a scene where he beats himself to a pulp ( don't ask why ) , tries to drink water to keep from having outbursts in the courtroom ( it fails , with semi-predictable results ) , and winds up biting the bullet when he gets called into the boardroom to have everyone ask what they think of them .  this scene alone may force people to stop the tape for minutes on end .  the movie sustains its laughs and also its flashes of insight until almost the end .  a shame , too , because the movie insists on having a big , ridiculous climax that involves carrey's character flagging down a plane using a set of motorized stairs , then breaking his leg , etc . a simple reconciliation would do the trick .  why is this stupid pent-up climax always obligatory ?  it's not even part of the movie's real agenda .  thankfully , liar liar survives it , and so does carrey .  maybe they were being merciful , on reflection .  if i'd laughed any more , i might have needed an iron lung .  
for more than a decade , anjelica huston has been one of america's finest actresses .  in her directorial debut , bastard out of carolina , based upon dorothy allison's largely autobiographical book on child abuse and poverty in the south , huston displays impressive proficiency behind the camera as well .  the film tells the story of ruth anne boatwright , nicknamed bone by one of her uncles at birth , in post-world war ii south carolina .  through voice-over ( narration done by laura dern ) , we find that she nearly didn't survive birth , as her single mother anney , played by jennifer jason leigh , was thrown through the windshield during an automobile accident .  that's just the beginning of her troubles .  bone is deemed illegitimate on her birth certificate , a social stigma which her mother and her large poor family obsesses over for years to come .  anney meets and weds lyle , a kind man and good stepfather whom gives bone a baby sister before dying in an automobile accident .  anney's brother earle , played by michael rooker , introduces her to glen , played by ron eldard , a co-worker at the mill .  glen , the black sheep of a wealthy family ( " when are you gonna make your daddy proud ?  i'll tell you when - never ! "  he's told ) and filled with bitterness , courts anney and eventually wins her , despite warnings of a violent temper .  when anney miscarries with his much-prized baby boy , glen loses his capability to supress his violent outbursts and begins to direct them at bone , beating and abusing her , while the love-dependent anney tries to turn a blind eye and justify his behaviour .  things turn for the worse when glen loses his job and the family of four sink into impoverishment .  while set several decades ago , this story remains completely relevant in today's society , where abused wives return to their husbands , and abuse committed against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked by the other .  the real star of this domestic drama is not top-billed jennifer jason leigh , but child actress jena malone , who plays bone in a wrenching and wholly impressive debut performance .  her work is of award-calibre , and in this age in which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged ( kirsten dunst , tina majorino , anna paquin , natalie portman , christina ricci , elijah wood ) , malone's performance stands up well .  leigh's performance in bastard out of carolina is fine , although she's not really given much to do , and ron eldard work is very solid , skillfully manouvering his character's moods in and out of explosive rage .  one can always sense that underneath his glen is a pressure-cooker ticking away .  of the supporting cast , special note must be made of the criminally underrated michael rooker's performance .  there's a bit too much generic formulaism in the screenplay for my taste , from the various characters spouting off country bumpkinisms , to the familiar sight of a dried-up uptight wise old granny ( played by grace zabriskie ) sitting on the porch rocking chair , to impassioned soliloquies better suited for a stage performance .  still , it cannot be denied that anne meredith's screenplay contains a wallop of emotional power .  huston's direction of the film is surehanded and impressive , giving the film good pacing and eliciting good performances from her cast , particularly the young malone .  her sequences of child abuse are shot in a hard-hitting emotional , rather than graphic , manner , and are very effective .  huston's talent with camera positioning is wonderful , from a visually striking shot done through a fan , to an extended sequence in the front seat of an automobile .  the film has the toned-down feel of a television production ; bastard out of carolina was originally composed and cut for broadcast on the tnt cable station , who ended up declining the film due to sentiments that scenes of abuse and rape in the film were too disturbingly realistic for their audience .  perhaps some sequences of the film may be unpleasant , but as a whole bastard out of carolina adds up to a powerful viewer experience worth seeing .  
catherine deane ( jennifer lopez ) is a psychologist who has been hired to participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up .  she has been experiencing moderate success with a young boy in a coma , but the boy's parents aren't happy with the apparent lack of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her regular life .  as if trying to assure the boy's parents wasn't hard enough on her , a new development arises that furthers the strain on deane's mental faculties .  a vicious serial killer named carl stargher ( vincent d'onofrio ) has been kidnapping women , locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in a matter of days , then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into life-sized dolls .  just after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell , stargher has a traumatic experience that triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia .  the police , led by fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victim's body , but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state .  in a last ditch attempt , they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering stargher's mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell . . .  a cell which will completely fill with water in the next 40 hours !  initial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix .  while it does share some characteristics with both films ( particularly the first forty minutes , which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs ) , the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm .  the buzz around this project is that first-time feature film director tarsem singh ( who won many awards for his video of r . e . m . 's " losing my religion " ) wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story , and a good portion of this film supports that theory .  despite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments , the cell does feature some remarkable imagery .  all of the sequences where we delve into someone's mind are incredibly beautiful ( including the dank mind of stargher , whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h . r . giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video ) , proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe .  the first sequence that takes place in stargher's mind is by far the best , featuring one of the most ingenious traps i've ever seen in a film ( involving a horse , which no one seeing this film will probably forget ) , a zoo-like display of stargher's victims which are animated like marionettes , and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room .  if the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant , but alas , the sequences only become more silly as they go along ( despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film ) .  the cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images , but at least vincent d'onofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance ( magnified by ten , thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed ) .  in my opinion , d'onofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film , but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful ( i . e . -  the newton boys , feeling minnesota , the thirteenth floor , and the velocity of gary ) that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him .  the character of stargher is an excellent role for him though , and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him .  detractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film , as it contains heavy doses of both .  besides the nipple ring removal i mention above , there is also stargher's penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs ( prior to his catatonia and capture ) which will have audiences recoiling .  a sequence where catherine enters stargher's mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting .  one moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spit-like device .  as a narrative film , the cell is sorely lacking .  as a collection of images though , the cell is extremely well done .  although the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half , singh has done what he supposedly set out to do : make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together .  unfortunately , a well-written script should have been considered too , because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv ( provided , of course , that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos ) .  
this has some major spoilers for the film , so be forwarned .  the won't appear till later in the article , so you're safe for now .  eyes wide shot ( 1999 ) running time : 2 hours 39 minutes 2 . 35 : 1 theatrical aspect  starring : tom cruise ( dr .  bill hardford ) , nicole kidman ( alice hardford ) , sidney pollack , leelee sobieski , todd field ( nick nightingale ) directed , co-written , produced by : stanley kubrick inspired by : " traumnovelle " by : arthur schnitzer  this is an interesting film .  i must first off state , that you musn't believe any of the rumors of the film .  cruise is not a cross dresser , kidman doesn't shoot heroin , and there's not any scene between the two that would suggest that they were aided by a sex therapist .  the look of the film is to suggest that it follows the translation of the inspired book from the film was written .  the translation , " dream novel , " makes you thing that the film should have been titled dream film .  there is a noticable amount of graininess to the film .  rather than complain about it as some may and already have , see it as a style of shooting .  i would gather that kubrick got on another lighting kick shooting this and shot with as much natural light as he could .  this and the film looks like it was pushed another two stops to add more grain and brighten it slightly .  as an auteur and stickler for details , kubrick seemed to be a bit lax on this one .  the film looks great , but there are a good deal of bloopers/flubs that occur .  you see lots of boom shots ( in reflection ) and you see the camera at least twice .  16 months for this ?  wow .  reflection is the biggest killer for this film .  their apartment and almost everything in the film casts reflections and the crew can be seen in these , some quite glaringly .  one more topic of heated discussion : i saw the " austin powers " version , and to be perfectly frank , unless you know where the overlays are supposed to be , you'll probably not see them .  two girls standing next to each other look a little suspicious , but i can wait for the unrated version on video to see it the way it's supposed to be .  spoilers below :  the film itself starts with ( cruise ) bill and ( kidman ) alice getting ready for a little x-mas soiree .  they go to a quite elegant party in what seems to be a storagehouse for lighting equipment , which is actually an apartment owned by pollack .  bill runs into an old friend from medical school who is now the party's entertainment .  soon after , bill and alice are flirting with others at the party , thinking that the other has not noticed .  bill is called to help with a partygoer who has had a bit too much of a good time .  the next day , bill and alice , casually smoking marijunana in their bedroom discuss the previous nights flirtations .  they both discover that they both knew about the flirting .  bill starts talking about what women can provide in a relationship , and gets alice extremely angry .  in her hazy state , she tells of an opportunity she almost acted on to cheat on bill , not caring about the possible aftereffects .  bill gets called away when one of his patients dies , and goes to console his daughter .  when his patient's engaged daughter makes a plea for his love and affection , he is struck with images of an affair that never occured between his wife , alice and a naval officer .  he sees " opportunity " as a betrayal to his wife , and before they can continue , they are interrupted .  as he strolls home , he encounters a hooker .  seeing another " opportunity " arise , he follows the hooker home .  they toy around , but before the act ensues , alice calls his cell phone .  he breaks the date with the hooker , and heads back out into the night .  he passes a lounge and notices that his old medical school buddy is playing , so he heads in .  when he meets the friend , the friend reveals that for extra scratch , he plays these strange parties , while blindfolded .  bill is intrigued and wants to go to one .  nick reluctantly sets him up with directions and a password .  what follows this is a short meeting where bill obtains a costume for this party and meets a young girl , leelee sobieski , and her father .  the young girl has drawn his eye , but her young age , and the prescence of her father deter this from happening .  he gets to the party , which is to say the least , a strange affair .  after partaking in some strange " religious " right , women and men pair off for the orgy to end all orgies .  a woman warns bill in disguise , that he should leave before he is exposed as a fraud at the party .  he is detained after a second warning , where he is outed for not being in the group .  after getting home , he hides the evidence of his evenings events .  unable to carry on in his day , he tries piece the events of the previous night together .  in the process , he finds that nick has disappeared , his life is possibly in danger , and the woman that warned him has died .  i'm trying to save a bit of the film here , it's worth sitting through to get to this point .  this is only about 100 minutes at this point .  this is a strange film , because despite the events that occur , the film has a strong family message behind it .  it will be hard to pidgeonhole this film as a certain kind of a film .  it's got sex in it , it has nudity , drugs , and many more immoralistic values .  but they all serve to show why they are bad in one's life .  i recommend this film highly on many merits .  cruise and kidman are rarely together for longer than 5 minutes after the opening scene , and the secrecy that shrouded the film should hopefully be apparent as to why it was kept once you see it for yourself .  
look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to the future .  some sort of decision had to be made , and , for better or worse , it irrevocably altered the course of your existence .  >from time-to-time , everyone thinks about the roads not taken , and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different .  perhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action -- catching the 10 am train , for example -- could have an equally profound , yet less obvious , impact .  maybe that's where you met your significant other , and , had you reached the platform just a few seconds later ?  film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else , and that's why there's no shortage of movies about this subject .  the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance .  these themes weave their way through many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red .  however , they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train ) changes the course of his life .  in his autobiography , kieslowski on kieslowski , the director describes his attraction to the concept this way : " [the idea is] rich and interesting ? that every day we're faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we're completely unaware . "  while this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films ( including , in a way , frank capra's it's a wonderful life ) , sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths .  the " road not taken " approach isn't just a plot device , either .  writer/director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just misses/catches a train .  the audience watches , with ever-growing fascination , how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life : her future career , where she lives , whom she loves , and whether she has a family .  as her separate destinies diverge and then re-converge , she becomes two completely different individuals .  that woman is helen , played by gwyneth paltrow as a long , dark- haired brit .  one day , after losing her job as an advertising executive , she decides to return home in the middle of the day .  the scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform .  in scenario #1 , she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station .  on board , she meets the cheerful , talkative james ( john hannah ) , a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty .  minutes later , in her flat , she walks in on her lover , gerry ( john lynch ) , in bed with another woman ( jeanne tripplehorn ) .  in scenario #2 , she misses the train and , shortly thereafter , is the victim of an attempted mugging .  she doesn't meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry's infidelity .  juxtaposed one against the other , while sharing many places , cues , and characters , the two stories proceed in parallel from there .  on one level , for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate , sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience .  but , for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting , a script with a few twists , and a great deal of genuinely funny material , sliding doors still fits the bill .  one of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences -- those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures , and those who could care less .  it shouldn't come as any surprise that the acting , at least from three of the four leads , is solid .  paltrow , who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same , yet gradually become much different , is the standout .  she plays both of her roles effectively and believably -- the shy , insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated , platinum-blond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man .  john hannah , known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral , is instantly likable .  john lynch , taking a break from movies about ireland's troubles , does a good job presenting gerry as a inept , selfish philanderer .  only jeanne tripplehorn , who plays an over-the-top vixen , seems out of place .  her attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring , and it's occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element .  one member of the supporting cast deserves special notice .  douglas mcferran , who plays gerry's best friend , russell , is an absolute delight , stealing every scene that he's in .  part of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie .  on one occasion , he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy .  on another occasion , while laughing at gerry's plight with the women in his life , he comments , " being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable . "  but it's not all in the dialogue .  mcferran tears into this part with relish ; his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a top-notch comedy .  this is the first feature film for peter howitt , and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb .  the script is shrewd and inventive , combining wit , romance , and intelligent melodrama into a crowd-pleasing whole .  sliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies , however .  for those who are so inclined , its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe -- all while having a good time .  
gordon fleming ( peter mullan ) is in a bind .  he has a new , unexpected baby and his business , hazardous material removal , is in danger of going under .  when he and his crew get a job opportunity at the long-abandoned danvers state hospital , he underbids the competition to secure the contract and promises to get the three-week job done in one .  it will prove to be a fateful week for them all in " session 9 . "  gordo gets the job to remove asbestos and other hazardous materials from the spooky old mental hospital in preparation for relocating town offices there .  their guided tour of the facility by a local official , bill giggs ( paul guilfoyle ) , brings them through some of the creepier parts of the former asylum .  but , a job is a job and , if they finish in a week , as promised , there is a $10000 bonus in store .  as they get down to their work , things , normal and not so normal , begin to happen .  gordon hears a disembodied voice beckoning him .  phil ( david caruso ) is conflicted working with a guy , hank ( josh lucas ) , who is seeing his old girlfriend .  mike ( co-screenwriter steven gevedon ) has discovered a cache of audiotapes and transcripts from old psychiatric sessions ( hence , the title ) with inmate mary hobbs , a multi-personality patient with a dark secret .  gordo's nephew , jeff ( brendan sexton iii ) , suffers from night phobia and is afraid to venture into the dark bowels of the hospital .  as the agreed upon week draws to an end , hank mysteriously disappears from the workplace after a nocturnal confrontation with someone ( something ? ) in the hospital .  tensions mount and distrust build among the rest as they watch their chance for the bonus start to slip away .  but , there is more , much more , at stake as the hospital and its history of insanity weigh on them all .  i don't want to give away too much of the story of " session 9 , " so i'll stop there .  what we have here is a spooky horror flick that uses none of the jump-out-at-you-from-the-dark cheap shots that have become part and parcel with horror films since the advent of " halloween " and " friday the thirteenth . "  there is no cat leaping out of the dark or the shock of suddenly seeing oneself in a strategically placed mirror .  with the exception of one shadowy and chilling image at one point spooky interlude in the film , there is little that you can get your arms around as far as what , specifically , is " frightening . "  as i watched " session 9 " i became aware of the subtle things that built up during the story that make it a true horror movie .  the striking high-definition video camera work by uta briesewitz ( who worked with the director , brad anderson , on his " next stop wonderland " ) helps to build up tension with close-ups , fluid camera movement and odd angles in a way that would make alfred hitchcock proud .  music , too , is used to intense effect , joining with the camera to make simple scenes frightening , even horrifying .  couple these tech feats with an intelligent story that uses elements of " the shining , " " the blair witch project " and , even " the texas chainsaw massacre " and you get a decent , intriguing horror flick .  additionally , the brilliant decision to shoot at danvers state hospital gives the film another starring character , the institution itself , which lends even more chills to the equation .  acting is another factor that raises " session 9 " above the usual dreck presented in recent horror hits like " scream , " " i know what you did last summer " and their sequels .  those films took good-looking , though generic , young actors and actresses and put them to use to build up a body count , substituting mayhem for real horror .  anderson opted , instead , to use mature , experienced actors like peter mullan and david caruso to fill his characters' shoes and the difference in casting quality is notable .  mullan , in particular , puts an arc on his character , gordon , as the troubled guy who slowly and inexorably falls under the pressures of family , job and , finally , danvers state hospital .  the rest of the small cast fit the bill as people , not just fodder for the mayhem .  david caruso , as gordo's senior man and near equal in the business , shows just how good an actor he is .  he made the jump from tv's " nypd blue " to film far too soon and his decisions in the roles he took ( i'll never forget the horrendous " jade " ) were less than star making .  he rolls his sleeves up and does the job well here .  gevedon , lucas and sexton are more than fodder , too .  the only problem with " session 9 " lay in the uninspired ending .  it takes on a fairly conventional finale that covers old ground and is a bit of a disappointment after the terrific ( and inspired ) build up .  the pleasure is getting there and i wish that anderson and gevedon had kept up the steam they had so ably built during the bulk of the film   " session 9 " is an unusual feat .  it is scary , doesn't use cheap tricks and raises goose bumps with its intelligently rendered , subtle horror .  because of the local interest of danvers , it should do well with the northeast crowd .  i hope it gets the national distribution it deserves .  i give it a b+ .  
mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence . )  with three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest " hot properties " in action adventure stardom , and it's just about time .  for over twenty-five years , jackie's been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy .   " drunken master " has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to " make it big " --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong .  i'm not entirely sure why , exactly .  in many ways , " drunken master " is similar to most of jackie's other early films , such as " fearless hyena " i and ii , " master with cracked fingers " , " half a loaf of kung fu " , " spiritual kung fu " , and others .  in fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories .  to be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste .  they're quite different from action movies as we know them in america .  these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together .   " drunken master " , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception .   ( as an aside , " drunken master " was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen . . . in  a movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival .  at the time , i didn't really think it was anything special . . . but  after having seen more films like it , it's kind of grown on me . )   " drunken master " 's storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as " fearless hyena " i and ii and " master with cracked fingers " --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been " adapted , " to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid ) .  more specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka " naughty panther , " a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough .  after embarrassing his instructor's assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can . . . and  is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively .  his father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages .  kei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all .  while escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more .  this turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu .  he assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up .  then , when he's ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu .  unfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them . . .   " drunken master " features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others .  it's been said before , but i'll say it again--these fights don't just _happen_ , they're as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows .  in his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways .  the fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films .  whether jackie wins or loses , it's really something to see . . . and  it's often as funny as anything , too .  and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at .  there's very little that's new in this movie--jackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training . . . these  schticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties .  but they're still hilarious as ever .  likewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they're often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own .  the really big thing about " drunken master " , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu .  i'm not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . . and  it apparently helps if you're drunk while you're doing it .  genuine or not , i have to admit , there's just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what's going on .  come to think of it , perhaps this element is what accounts for this film's success over any of the other jackie films . . . it's  not just martial arts , it's the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go , " whoa . . . "  on the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special , the film stock is rather primitive , the plot is often rather slow , and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background .   " gone with the wind " , this isn't .  still , if you like martial arts films , or like what you've seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more , give it a shot .  it's much more " real " than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme .  you might very well like it .  another interesting thing about " drunken master " has to do with its video availability in the us .   " drunken master " is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original , letterboxed , hong kong subtitled form , commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video , in a gold box , for about $10 ) .  there are plenty of other early jackie films around , but these are typically either in dubbed , pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase .  thankfully , " drunken master " , at least , is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen , at a very affordable price .  if you like " drunken master " , take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there ( even the dubbed ones aren't really _too_ bad . . . if  nothing else , you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ) .  i particularly recommend " spiritual kung fu " , " half a loaf of kung fu " , the " fearless hyena " movies , and " snake & crane arts of shaolin " .  also , the mostly-unrelated-storywise sequel , " drunken master ii " , will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year ( though what its american-release title will be is still uncertain ) and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer .  also , for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei-hong ( who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore ) , i've been told to suggest the " once upon a time in china " series starring jet li ( though i haven't personally seen any of them yet ) .  if you choose to watch " drunken master " , i really hope you enjoy it , and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that's out there .  all in all , i give this film an .  
with many big-budget science fiction films , great ideas are often wasted by bad scripts , cheesy plot twists , and , terrible acting .  the fifth element , the abyss , and godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting , writing , or both .  at first glance , the matrix , larry & andy wachowski's sci-fi/kung-fu/shoot-em-up spectacular , looks like a prime candidate to join the list of high-concept bad movies , especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role .  but despite high levels of cheese and gaudy dialogue , the matrix works .  it's an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films ( most obviously the terminator films , star wars , and total recall ) , but remains refreshingly original and interesting throughout .  reeves plays neo , a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering set of encounters with " trinity " ( carrie-anne moss ) , a rival hacker who has supernatural powers and stunning good looks , a unseen , omniscient cult figure known as " morpheus " ( lawrence fishburne ) , and a trio of creepy men in dark suits who act like irs agents from hell .  neo quickly learns that the world he has known all his life is not what it seems .  moreover , he discovers that the grim , bleak world he is introduced to has been waiting for him to save it .  neo is reluctant to assume the role of messiah , with grave doubts that he is actually " the one " prophesized to come and save the world .  reluctant or not , what follows is a mix of hong kong-style slow-motion shootouts , surreal dream sequences , high speed chases , and comic book kung-fu fights .  the film also raises interesting philosophical questions about reality .  how exactly do you know what is real and what is in your mind ?  and if the real world were much harsher and grim than a fantasy one you were living in , would you want to face the true world or continue to live in a more comfortable illusion ?  unfortunately , the matrix doesn't provide many answers to the questions it raises , but at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions , shoot-outs , and flying roundhouse kicks .  perhaps stealing the entire show in the matrix is australian actor hugo weaving , who plays agent smith , the leader of the creepy agents in sunglasses and suits who seem capable of being anywhere and doing anything to stop neo and friends from destabilizing the matrix .  weaving's stony appearance , deadpan voice , and chilling comments put a grim human face on the haunting , evil technological force that controls the matrix .  like robert patrick as the shapeshifting t-1000 terminator in terminator 2 : judgement day , weaving is more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because , despite his power and seeming invincibility , he looks ordinary , even scrawny .  weaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence .  the film features some truly breathtaking special effects and stylish cinematography .  it seems to be deliberately kitchy , with stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly required months of martial arts training by the actors .  in a few scenes , the posing and posturing is unintentionally funny .  just seeing keanu reeves engaging in serious kung fu is a bit jarring .  however , with the comic-book style and tone of the film , you can sustain willing disbelief long enough to enjoy the ride without losing patience .  the matrix isn't a classic .  its open-ended and confusing conclusion raises more questions than it answers .  it fails to resolve many of its own plot twists and philosophical questions .  it also relies on some conventional sentimentality to save the hero - the kind of shmaltzy feel-good goo that most of the film avoids .  reportedly , the producers have high hopes for the film being the first in a trilogy and have already begun work on the story for the sequel .  unfortunately , audiences deserve a little more than a vague sense that the story will continue in the future .  the matrix is an fun , enjoyable diversion , like a big puff of cotton candy at a carnival .  just don't be surprised half an hour later when you still feel a little hungry .  
ingredients : james bond , scuba scene , car controlled by cellular telephone  synopsis : warped media tycoon elliot carver ( jonathan pryce ) plots to start a war between britain and china in order to boost ratings by using a 'stealth ship' to fire a captured british missile at the city of beijing .  super-agent james bond ( pierce brosnan ) uses trick gadgets , pluck , and charm in order to foil carver's scheme .  this time bond teams up with top female agent wai lin from china ( michelle yeoh ) .  the film contains fights , chases , gadgets , and comedic moments .  opinion : it does not have a casino scene or a ski scene , but tomorrow never dies is nevertheless a solid , enjoyable bond movie .  it neither stands out nor disappoints .  in old bond movies bond sometimes teamed up with american cia agent felix leiter .  tomorrow never dies introduces a new character in the form of chinese agent wai lin .  like leiter's character , wai lin would be a sure bet for a cameo in a later bond movie .  stars : michelle yeoh was born a leo in the western zodiac in the year of the tiger on the asian astrology calendar .  i dont believe in horoscopes .  but at an airport i once browsed an astrology book with a section on leo tigers ( lts ) .   " leo tigers prefer enough solitude to grow at their own pace .  lts are unbelievably courageous when facing adversity .  the lt is also classy , and has an excellent sense of refinement , but she sees herself as an adventurer , and prefers freedom of movement rather than flashy status symbols .  this person loves family and friends with a fierce loyalty .  she delights in siblings , nephews , nieces and extended family - - but she must have her personal freedom to come and go as she pleases .  sometimes annoyance at injustice drives her to take up one or two causes .  in love life , the lt has an unfortunate mental block against committing to any partner who is less powerful than she . "  in real life , michelle yeoh is asia's top female star .  like jackie chan , she does her own stunts .  she was born in malaysia - - a country of many languages - - and her primary language ( the language she speaks in her sleep ) is english .  she was taught malay in school , and learned cantonese from bilingual parents .  as an athlete michelle represented malaysia internationally .  she enjoyed squash , diving , swimming , and rugby .  she studied ballet at the royal academy of dance in london , but switched to drama after a spinal injury .  in 1983 she won the miss malaysia pageant - - without really intending to , since a family member had entered her in the contest without her knowledge .  notoriety from the contest led eventually to a movie career as an action heroine .  michelle has survived a divorce with asian retail tycoon dickson poon ; a nearly fatal stunt accident falling from a freeway overpass which put her in the hospital for three months , and ; a retirement from the movies .  her comeback from retirement , supercop ( 1992 ) became the top grossing film in asia that year .  it is not clear what michelles martial arts style is , but it may be a theatrical version of wing chun .  of her character wai lin in tomorrow never dies , michelle says , " wai lin is the first bond girl who is on a par with bond , someone who can match up with him mentally and physically . "  my own opinion is that casting michelle yeoh as agent wai lin was an excellent choice .  
supposedly based on a true story in which the british drive to build a rail bridge deep in africa grinds to a halt after a pair of lions start killing off the workers in 1898 .  john patterson ( val kilmer ) , the bridge building expert set to oversee the operation , tried to rid his operation of the lions , but fails .  a world renound hunter , remington ( michael douglas ) , is called in and the battle , man against lion , begins .  this film has a great soundtrack , and wonderful scenery .  the acting is not too bad except the characters are all so thin .  we only see one side of each character .  kilmer is a bridge builder and that's all we see him as .  these lions kill dozens of his men and he doesn't even appear to be too upset about it .  and the plot ?  it's jaws , but with lions .  again we're presented with an animal that behaves not at all as it should .  it appears to kill men because it just likes too .  why ?  who knows .  i guess there wouldn't be much of a story if it didn't .  the problem is that there isn't much of a story even though it does .  
writer/director lawrence kasdan had a hand in penning some of the biggest film successes of the 1980s .  yes , that's right , he co-wrote raiders of the lost ark ( 9/10 ) , the empire strikes back ( 8 . 5/10 ) and return of the jedi ( 8/10 ) .  now with this film , it looks as though he has decided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting and bland directing .  and guess what ?  he succeeds once again !  plot : a man with a shady and regrettable past decides to run away and into a small american town , where he pretends to be a licensed psychologist to an open-armed swarm of people with problems .  it isn't long before he befriends the small-town billionaire , folks become suspicious and he falls for one of his own patients .  critique : this film is not a comedy !  it is a drama .  i say this right up front because from the looks of the trailer , you would think that this film secures its base in humor , but unfortunately for us , it does not .  it is a serious film ( seriously flawed if you ask me , but i digress ) which offers a couple of witty quips to keep you awake , but overall , just sits there .  now on to my review .  this movie sucks because it was slow and boring , starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past , included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best and pissed at worst , and certified it all with many a predictable ending .  i have no idea what lawrence kasdan was trying to accomplish with this picture , but whatever it was . . . he  missed !  anyone without his name could never have made this film because it is an extremely generic puff-piece , which on a good day , might be described as predictably digestible .  it's no wonder that the studio is trying to sell it as a comedy !  it sucks as a drama , and bored my movie cohort right to sleep .  i've given it four points on four extremely shallow yet distinguishable marks .  first of all , i couldn't help but think about how much the lead actor , loren dean , looked like a young charles grodin .  he even acted like him , save for the dry , sardonic wit .  this kept me interested in watching him at least .  number two , and this one is really shallow ( seemed to be geared that way as well ) , there were quite a few " titshots " , as they would say back in high school .  and god help me if i can't get enough of those in an aimless drama .  and three , and this one surprised me the most , actor ted danson's cameo ( yes , he will always be sam malone to us real fans ! ) was the best part about this movie and actually made me see him as a different person .  a different asshole , but a different person nonetheless .  if ever you rent this movie one day ( promise you won't throw away your hard-earned money at the theaters ? ! ) ,  wait for his scene because it's actually pretty good .  other than that , drab , drab , drab and drab .  even jason lee , a personal favorite of mine , was left out to dry with lame dialogue and one of the phoniest romances to hit the big screen in a while .  well , at least he finally " came out " and did some real skateboarding in this movie !  oh yeah , and i guess that's the fourth point in my rating .  anyway , if you enjoy watching boring patients babble on about their boring problems to an uninteresting psychologist . . . this  film's your bag !  otherwise , skip it and see analyze this ( 8/10 ) again . . . now  there's a great shrink movie !  little known facts about this film and its stars : " three's company " fans alert ! ! !  terri from the tv show , also known as actress priscilla barnes , plays a small but pivotal part as the landlady in this film .  the scene is actually a fantasy sequence and does feature cleavage , so stay tuned , kids !  also , it is to note that the actress was once named " penthouse pet of the month " in march of 1976 .  she was known as one joann witty back then .  she's originally from jersey .  who the hell is loren dean , the dude who plays mumford in this film ?  you got me , but all i know is that he was born in las vegas in 1969 and played the character of billy bathgate in the 1991 film of the same name .  jason lee was born in the state of california in the year of 1971 .  he was a professional skateboarder before his acting career took off after mallrats ( 6/10 ) , and even owns his own skateboarding company called stereo manufacturing corp . he's been in every kevin smith film except for clerks ( 8 . 5/10 ) .  listen closely and you will hear the pharmacist in this film ( the ballooning actor formerly known as pruit taylor vince ) make a reference to the " lost ark " , which is obviously an in-joke , considering that it is the writer/director of this film , lawrence kasdan , who co-wrote raiders of the lost ark ( 9/10 ) .  kasdan also played the part of dr . green in 1997's as good as it gets ( 8/10 ) .  ted danson also played the role of lawyer peter lowenstein in kasdan's 1981 directorial debut body heat starring a sexy kathleen turner and william hurt .  
 " alcohol and drugs = bad .  not alcohol and drugs = good .  got it ? "  just when you though you've seen enough of brave young women dealing with their personal problems on screen , be that insanity or alcoholism , hollywood releases yet another one of those 'deep , emotional stories about finding yourself' . .  '28 days' is practically a visualization of the usual 'meaningful' true stories that people are so proudly retelling at aa-meetings .  gwennie ( sandra bullock ) is a young woman who drowned her problems in alcohol .  for her life was a big party , with no beginning and no end .  this behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister and from life itself .  her existence is filled with endless parties and comic episodes .  such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper ( dominic west ) , borrowed her sister's ( elizabeth perkins ) wedding limo and crashed it into someone's house .  this time she had to pay with a 28 day stay in court-ordered rehab .  here she must realize that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption , willpower and commitment .  most important she must realize her place and direction in life and understand that her life is not just a big party .  the film itself feels like a rehab program , whining and moaning about things that have been said and written a million times .  it is a classic cautionary tale .  an echo .  a big , fat and expensive clich ? .  a shadow of last year's 'girl , interrupted' , which likewise followed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like 'the cuckoo's nest' and 'trainspotting' .  director betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures and errors , that it is impossible to sum them all up in one review .  for some paranoid reason she decided to make her film a drama/comedy .  jokes and funny characters almost deliberately delude you from the really important and complex issues : alienation , despair , terror , confusion , loneliness .  and what awesome power and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that and become clean .  isn't that what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first place ?  even the transition process itself seems like a walk in the park . betty thomas' idea of hell is a cozy , homey place where happy alcoholics and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke , drink or watch tv after 11 .  it is simply too light , simplified and unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously .  but the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance .  that it actually tries to educate the audience with its extremely predictable and primitive story .   " all you need to do is just say no " , says dr . cornell ( steve buscemi ) as if was the revelation of the century .  and that's how simple it is !  in fact i would rather watch 'lost in space' once again , than return to '28 days' .  as for acting , it's acceptable , but hardly anything else .  for sandra bullock it's an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of more than 'speed' .  she handles her part with a surprising professionalism and ease that certainly saves the film from being a complete flop .  dominic west shines as the source of gwenie's devilish temptations , but elizabeth perkins' and steve buscemi's great talents are wasted on unnoticeable and shallow characters .  although intellectually 'girl , interrupted' was a greater achievement , '28 days' is superior in its visual aspect .  there are some nice flash back sequences and occasionally impressive pacing , but the overall technical aspect of this film is on the ground floor .  the most important thing is that we've seen it before and it was a lot better .  'clean and sober' , 'only when i laugh' , 'when a man loves a woman' , 'leaving las vegas' and many other stronger films were made about the same issues .  so what's the point ?  in other words '28 days' doesn't contribute to the moviemaking business on any level .  if you're caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky and you're standing in front of the movie theatre , you might as well go in and watch '28 days' .  under all other circumstances stay away , because this film equals $8 and 103 minutes lost .  
before the remake of psycho appears , we've got to suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film , dial m for murder .  as usual , hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars , and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing .  the film opens with emily ( paltrow ) and david ( viggo mortensen ) 'having fun' in an loft apartment .  the problem is , paltrow is married to stephen ( douglas ) , who is not too happy when he discovers this affair .  if i was paltrow , though , i'd definitely go with mortensen .  less wrinkles .  anyhow , stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition : he'll pay him to kill his lovely wife .  mortensen agrees , but the murder goes awry , and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses .  unfortunately , the film dosen't progress very fast .  in fact , it moves like a tortoise with arthritis ( read : very , very s-l-o-w . )  the plot moves nowhere fast , and only becomes exciting in very short bursts .  not too good for a 'thriller . '  also , the performances , apart from douglas , are below par .  paltrow , showing immense talent in se7en ( 1995 ) and sliding doors ( 1997 ) is strangely stilted , even unconvincing , in this movie .  mortensen is a little bit better , coming across as a younger douglas , but his role isn't meaty enough to show all his talent .  which leaves douglas to waltz away with the film , which is does .  however , i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking , drinking womanizer with a creepy underside .  also popping up in the film is david suchet , playing a shifty looking detective .  again , it's not a character we're seeing on the screen , it's david suchet .  the director , who bought us the fugitive , piles on all the flash techniques , such as zoom-in's , quick cuts , etc . the lighting is also interesting .  however , looks can't save this film from the depths of mediocre , and the film seemed to work better in a single set anyway .  the screenplay is o . k , but there's some hackneyed sub-plot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street ( again ) and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched .  the characters also make incredibly dumb moves , especially paltrow , and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel .  with a combination of no tension , drama , or decent characters , a perfect murder is a failure all round , and an incredible disappointment .  there are a few bright moments , but they are far and few between .  the last thing a thriller should be is boring , and although the film just barely manages to keep your interest thanks to michael douglas , you wouldn't be missing anything if you decided not to watch a perfect murder .  overall rating=  review by david wilcock ? 1998   " you know , for kids " - norville barnes  
old soldiers never die , they just turn into cliches  soldier a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman  the warrior and the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult to exist in the same body .  jungian archetypes , these two opposites need each other to create a whole , but it's difficult to integrate both .  often we'll encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful and , with the help of jung's magician , sit around imagining grand schemes .  without the drive to manifest their plans , much less the wisdom to recognize the darkness , all they have are dreams .  warriors on the other hand , are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat , and will do combat with every last bit of their energy .  they don't care enough about anything to know what's worth fighting for : gladiators who live only for the battle .  this dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know , but can also illustrate societies .  america during the late sixties was a conflict between old style cold warriors and the new hippie lovers .  todd 3465 ( kurt russell ) is a living , breathing archetype .  chosen from birth as a soldier , he is raised by the government to be a killing machine .  his childhood is cruelty and competition .  he is indoctrinated with the big rules .  never question authority .  winning is everything .  strength beats knowledge .  a veteran of numerous intergalactic wars , todd is 40 and he's obsolete .  a new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger .  left for dead after a test battle with the best of the new killers , caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) , he's unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia 234 , a garbage world .  obviously our hero is still alive .  he finds a group of shipwrecked settlers abandoned on the planet who nurse him back to health .  when the peace-loving colonists get a good look at who todd is , they are afraid of him and he is exiled to live by himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world .  they are the other good guys .  these lovers find that they need a warrior when the military coincidentally chooses this world to conduct exercises for their improved human weapons .  todd finds himself in the role of protector .  what could have been a fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and the fears of an ultra-right wing future is ruined by turning the film into a cartoon .  the effects are mostly second-rate explosions or jerky slow motion .  the plot is old hat .  we don't get even a glimpse at the society that created the soldiers .  hardly anything makes sense .  the film's science fares badly .  with all the remarkable advances we've made in just 37 years ( the film takes place in 2036 ) , we're still stupid .  after conquering the stars , for some reason we use vast amounts of energy to load up huge space ships with rubbish tote it to a landfill light years away .  even stranger , the garbage barges appear to double as time machines .  virtually all the trash is vintage 1960 .  there is nothing in the story that is not predictable .  the first thing that todd sees after coming back to life is sandra ( connie nielsen ) , the woman just a little too beautiful to be living in such harsh conditions who is taking care of him .  it doesn't take a genius to foresee that her husband isn't going to be around much longer .  is it a shock to find out that the film's climax is an unarmed battle between todd and caine ?  who would you guess wins ?  some of the scenes would work if this were a comedy .  todd's first awakening of human emotion comes when he glimpses connie's nipple poking through her thin blouse .  later as he sits by his lonely campfire , a tear rolls down his dramatically lighted cheek in slow motion .  supposedly this clich ? isn't meant to be humorous .  dastardly col . mekum ( jason isaacs ) with a pencil-thin mustache is as real as snidley whiplash .  responsible for last year's quirky and visually enticing but problematic " the fifth element " , director paul anderson sees the film as " shane " in outer space .  maybe , if shane were played by sylvester stallone in rambo mode .  the movie doesn't even work as an action film .  there is never a question as to the outcome .  somehow the new superior soldiers don't prove much of a match for todd .  the acting isn't anything to write home about .  nielsen almost comes across as a real person but is soon relegated to a background victim .  russell is buffed-up and does a credible job but it's not much of a challenge .  uttering around 100 words during the film , mostly what todd does is hit things and stare grimly into space .  gary busey as todd's commanding officer is completely wasted in his low-key role .  everything blows up and occasionally it looks cool .  sometimes the sets are impressive .  unfortunately " occasionally " and " sometimes " don't make a film .  most disappointing is that the screenplay is by david webb peoples who wrote " blade runner " , possibly the best science fiction movie ever made .  sharp-eyed viewers will notice a few obscure references to that film .  peoples says that this is not a " blade runner " sequel , but a " sidequel " that takes place in the same universe .  although that may have been the intent in his original script , the result is more like a bad television series that the " blade runner " replicants watch to pass time .  perhaps those artificial humans would find this entertaining .

i have never been a " star trek " fan , and , to tell the truth , out of the five films in the series that i have seen ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 9 ) , i have disliked all of them .  i do , however , always go into one of these with an open mind , and the ninth film in the series , " star trek : insurrection , " is no exception .  dropping almost completely the hard-core sci-fi element of the previous one in the series , " first contact , " " insurrection , " tells the story of a planet that holds only 600 people , known as the ba'ku , as well as the fountain of youth .  at the start of the picture , the villagers go under attack by a second alien species , known as the son'a , who want to push all of the ba'ku out so that their own race will not die out .  also attacking the ba'ku is data ( brent spiner ) , a robot from the star trek enterprise .  after returning to jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the gang on their space ship , no one can understand why data was somehow taken over by another force .  so several of the star trek members travel down to the planet of the ba'ku , where picard meets up and starts to fall in love with one of the inhabitants , a sultry , kind alien woman ( donna murphy ) , who is over six-hundred-years-old , but looks to only be in her thirties .   " star trek : insurrection , " is a completely unoriginal and cheap-looking installment in the series , and is a big step down from , 1996's " first contact , " which at least appeared to try to make something a bit different .  in , " insurrection , " however , it plays like a low-rent episode of the television show , due to the small-scale , generic storyline , and an emphasis on one-liners rather than excitement .  the film was filled with nearly non-stop comedy , and worse yet , most of it fell flatter than a cartoon character that drops off a cliff .  meanwhile , when there were action sequences , they were not at all interesting or inventive , relying on that old reliable ticking timer that counts down very , very slowly .  this plot device , which is seen in just about every action film made nowadays , is getting old fast .  are filmmakers so bankrupt of ingenuity and ideas that they must always have a timer ticking away during the climax ?  another element of , " star trek , " films in general is that picard seems to always have to have a love interest , but then she always miraculously disappears when the next film is made two or three years later .  although donna murphy , who falls victim to this thankless love interest role here , is actually one of the few characters that we get to know in the 103-minute running time , alfre woodard was far superior in , " first contact . "  she should have returned for this one , but i don't blame her for not wanting to waste her time with this movie's disappointing and often lifeless screenplay , by michael piller .   " star trek : insurrection , " is perhaps the weakest film in the " star trek , " series , although i have not seen what is widely considered the worst , " star trek v : the final frontier . "   " insurrection , " is the type of " safe " sequel that will bewilder non-fans , since it is so low-tech compared to most of today's blockbuster action films ( although most of these are honestly not very good , either ) , and should disappoint the loyal trekkies , since it could have easily been better if the makers had realized that the screenplay needed to go through a few more drafts .  on second thought , they probably should have completely thrown the script out .  that way , they could have come up with a story that at least had a sign of intelligence and freshness .  
in the continuation of warner brother's franchise , joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow .  what makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film .  avika goldsman's screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another .  this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as " the client " is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke .  situations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another .  this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone's batgirl , who just happens to be alfred's niece .  the story of dr . victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought .  while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife , dr . freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure , and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment .  now of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live .  now the logic of that little sub-plot escapes me .  if mr . freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death , why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth .  this is indeed a cold hearted man .  the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory .  she wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal .  she joins with mr . freeze in his plan to start a new ice age , destroying all animal life , therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them .  the characters have no logic .  batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films .  now that he has an adoptive son in burt ward / robin , bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure , constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships , while at the same time not really having any .  george clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him .  to say that his performance is workman-like is to be generous .  his best performances are still on " e . r . " .  bruce wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend ( played by elle macpherson ) , that it brings into question bruce's latent homosexuality .  there is no spark and no passion ( as there was for nicole kidman's psychologist in " batman forever " ) between bruce and anyone other than alfred .  and even that relationship is very reserved .  robin comes off less charismatic that in the last film in the series .  now he's just a spoiled kid .  in " batman forever " , burt ward wanted to be batman's partner and friend .  now , robin is suffering from ego deficiency .  robin's attraction for poison ivy is not believable , except for a boy around the age of 15 .  his later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest , even though they are not related in a traditional sense .  chris o'donnell , once considered a rising star , successfully burns up on reentry with this performance .  his robin needs nothing more than a good spanking .  the less said about alicia silverstone's performance the better .  this talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film .  she was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it .  this brings us to the villains .  arnold scharzenegger walks through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday .  the most rediculous scene is during mr . freeze's imprisonment .  the guards are at least a foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fights scenes caught on film .  it's almost as ludicrous as seeing michael jackson as a gang member .  umu thurman struts and coos her way through her part , showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status .  her poison ivy has all the come hither sex appeal of may west in " sextette " ( 1978 ) .  the only performances worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough .  these two seasoned veterans carry their scenes with a dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film .  without going through the intricacies of the plot , there is one question that always comes to mind with this series ( except for the first " batman " ) , and that is how do these super villains manage to hire so many thugs only to abandon them at the final reel .  mr . freeze is introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlums that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video .  every villain ( even the minor ones ) have to have a look , no one can be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume .  with this film , warner brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series back to it's tv incarnation .  the only thing missing from the action scenes are the superimposed titles detailing the pows ! ,  gwaaaa's , and clang's associated with the old series .  you almost wonder if william dozier , producer of the tv series is collecting royalties from this film .  the special effects ( by john dykstra ) and production design ( by barbara ling ) are the primary stars of this film .  and it is a case of extravagance in the pursuit of nothing .  every set , from ivy's lair , the batcave , to freeze's hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to keep the epa in paperwork for years to come .  there is no one realistic set or set piece in the film .  everything is set for maximum exposure .  the special effects have that strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effects have .  there are homage thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on " the time machine " ( the growing plant scene ) but these scenes are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are almost obscured .  joel schumacher has directed the film with no flair .  camera angles are poorly chosen rehashing set ups from the old tv series .  master shots pepper the action scenes , destroying any flow of kinetic quality they may have had .  mr . schumacher is a good director .  one just has to look back on the films " the lost boys " , " cousins " ( an underrated film ) and " the client " to know that .  but " batman and robin " comes off as a mated made for tv movie .  the film has no style of individuality .  it is the cinematic equivalent to jell-o , pretty to look at , but empty .  it is unfortunate that this film , even with it's surprisingly strong box office has succeeded in doing what warner's thought tim burton would do with the franchise .  kill it .  joel schumacher's " batman & robin " is loud , colorful , action packed , and ultimately . .  boring .  stars .  
when it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy , i expect negative reviews from critics left and right .  predictable , unoriginal , and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to you's and the drive me crazy's released by the dozens these last couple of years .  what i really look for in this kind of movie is the entertainment value while i'm sitting in the theater .  am i enjoying myself ?  is this a comfortable break from my week of finals ?  this is why i have given films like final destination or road trip high marks ; i had a party of a time wasting my money on something i won't remember next week .  so last week i opened up the new york times - and , no surprise , boys and girls got a negative review .  daily news ?  negative .  reelviews ?  negative .  epinions . com ?  negative .  this was nothing new .  american pie , final destination , road trip didn't get such hot reviews and i loved those guilty pleasures .  same goes for she's all that , a formulaic but enjoyable pygmalion adaptation that got unjustly pounded .  since boys and girls reunites she's all that director robert iscove and actor freddie prinze jr . , i predicted d ? j ? vu al over again .  but , still curious , i asked around my school and from the one or two people who had seen it , the reactions were far from positive .  i had made up my mind ; i'll catch it on video or cable in a couple of years .  but , soon after , following a series of unexpected events ( we couldn't get into shaft because it is rated r ) , i found myself watching boys and girls .  whoops .  boys and girls is about a " nerdy , smart " boy named ryan ( prinze jr . ) and a " popular , flirt " girl named jennifer ( claire forlani ) .  briefly meeting as pre-teens and now attending the same college , the two bump into each other so many times that eventually they become best friends .  but in the movies , a male and a female cannot be friends without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other .  with advice from their roommates ( amanda detmer , jason biggs ) , ryan and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship .  the film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives - and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found .  i could hardly sit through the 93 minute running time for several reasons .  the dialogue is probably the worst i have ever seen in any movie , mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous words these characters use is what hollywood thinks kids can relate to .  it is almost offensive .  an example of an insightful conversation :   " you're dumb .  dumb , dumb , dumb , dumb . "   " no . "   ( followed by a mandy moore-esque tune background )   ( well it's not as bad as wing commander i guess )  the supporting cast is also painfully useless .  detmer and biggs stand in the way for anything interesting to happen with their own boring , pointless subplots .  and although this is supposed to be from both perspectives of the human sex , prinze jr's ryan dominates the screen while forlani's jennifer simply acts as a dilemma for him to work with .  we never learn anything about jennifer which is a shame too because forlani is the only actor to bring any life into her character .  teenager or not : you'll hate this movie , i guarantee it .  maybe i should rent she's all that again .  is it really as good as i think it is ?  
a month ago i wrote that speed 2 was the worst film i've ever reviewed on paper .  i didn't know at the time that i'd soon encounter and despise batman & robin , which has just overtaken speed 2 as the picture least worthy of your attention this summer .  as directed by joel schumacher ( who now specializes in batman sequels and john grisham adaptations and isn't very good at either ) , b & r is one long excuse for a taco bell promotion .  the plot , which has mr . freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) planning to take over gotham city and then " the vorld " ( as an oddly ineffective schwarzenegger states ) , is weighted down by repetitive asides about the nature of trust , partnership , blah , blah , blah .  but morals are not the point of this film--topping each bloated , confusing action scene with next one is .  the garish art direction and overlit cinematography make this picture oddly comparable to the trashy showgirls .  since when did gotham city become a giant las vegas hotel ?  only george clooney comes out on top ; he underplays nicely and pretends like he's in a real movie .  
so , it's thirty years later , and oscar and felix are together again .  that might have been an exciting notion if it wasn't for the fact that the " odd couple " of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies : 1993's " grumpy old men , " 1995's " grumpier old men , " and 1997's " out to sea " ( i . e .   " grumpiest old men " ) .  so , " the odd couple ii " ( i . e .   " the grumpiest old men of all , really " ) seems just another entry in a tired series .  the plot is even similar to that of " grumpy old men " in that lemmon and matthau's mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children .  oscar's son ( jonathan silverman ) and felix's daughter ( lisa waltz ) are getting married , and former roommates felix ungar ( lemmon ) and oscar madison ( matthau ) meet at the airport and decide to share a car .   .   .  then hilarity ensues .  well , a few chuckles ensue anyway .  neil simon , the award-winning playwright who created oscar and felix , provides the screenplay , which is a shock , because the script is a piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end .  unlike the original play/movie , " odd couple ii " doesn't find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters .  instead , it depends upon a series of humorous situations : oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff , are caught smuggling mexicans over the border , take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands ( the women are played by christine baranski of " cybill " and jean smart of " designing women " ) , and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert .  the original 1968 movie " the odd couple " remains a classic comedy .  it introduced the motif of roommate-as-spouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since .  it was the second outing for the lemmon/matthau team ( which debuted in 1966's " the fortune cookie " ) , and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies , " the front page " ( 1974 ) and " buddy buddy " ( 1981 ) , before going their separate ways .  the reunion of lemmon and matthau in " grumpy old men " six years ago was delightful , and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie .  but " out to sea " and " the odd couple ii " are just beating a grumpy old horse .   ( you can add lemmon's " my fellow americans , " i . e .   " grumpy old presidents , " to that list , too . )  let's hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do .  let's hope also that we see neil simon's name on movies that do it justice ( this is his first since 1993's " lost in yonkers " ) .  
capsule : where are you tonight , leni rienfenstal ?  starship troopers is an expensive , hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography -- and bad pornography , at that .  it is not good cinema , not good storytelling , and not even stupid fun : it's so cynically , calculatedly bone-headed that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed .  it's one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time .  why am i calling this movie pornography ?  pornography , in the abstract , is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts .  i remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie , where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper , as " a near-pornographic eternity " .  i didn't agree with that assessment , but i could see what was being implied : the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout " do 'er , man , do 'er ! "  that sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers .  it's * literally * like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk .  it tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening .  the film takes place in our future , when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesn't appear to have intelligence .  to counterattack , humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable : instead of nuke the planet from orbit , which they're clearly capable of , they send down grunts with m-16 rifles .  this isn't heinlein , it's a bad wwii movie , one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy , repetitive , and ultimately tiresome .   ( one scene has a journalist on a battlefield , filimg soldiers being slaughtered , and ends with groaning predictability : said cameraman gets skewered , too . )  the soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic .  they do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense .  they don't even behave like soldiers in a bad * movie * , and therefore we don't care about them .  we hated the tom berenger character in platoon , but he * mattered * , and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate .  here , we don't even hate the bugs -- what's there to hate ?  hating them would be like cursing a hurricaine .  if there's anything really hateful there , the movie doesn't know how to give it to us .  the screenwriter ( ed neumeier -- perhaps a better appelation would be " screen typist " ) and director ( the increasingly talent-impaired paul verhoeven ) have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other .  one of the subplots concerns a woman pilot who's great at getting out of tight situations , and does it again and again and again .  once or twice is fine .  by the fifth or sixth time , it's worn out its welcome .  there's never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything , or really being tested to show their mettle .  also , the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry .  if a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp , then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing a damned thing .  but if one human gets cornered , he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip .  uh-huh .  the very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasi-fascist flavor .  i say " quasi- " because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action -- the gear , the uniforms , etc . -- the movie doesn't have the nerve ( or the brains ) to be genuinely fascist , or intelligent about the subject .  the bumpers between scenes , which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda -- just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison .  like the rest of the movie .  there's more , i suppose , but it's not worth it .  the acting is bland , neither arsenic nor gravy ; the music disposable ; the camerawork turgid .  the heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like a masterpiece .  
if you don't think kevin kline in drag is funny , wait ? til you see will smith in drag-it's even less funny .  by the time jim west ( smith ) disguised himself as a belly dancer to bail his captured comrade , artemus gordon ( kline ) , from the clutches of evil dr . loveless ( branagh ) , i was unequivocally bored by wild wild west , the new summer blockbuster from men in black director barry sonnenfeld .  is the old west really a breeding ground for high comedy , anyway ?   ( if your answer is no , then you recall rustler's rhapsody or back to the future part iii ; if your answer is yes , you're thinking of blazing saddles , but that movie was a parody of the western genre , not a nineteenth century romp . )  1869 . jim west is a quick-draw lawman who teams up with brainiac federal agent gordon , under orders from president grant ( kline again , whose impression , for all we know , is dead-on ) , to apprehend legless loveless , the mad inventor who is plotting to divvy up the united states and sell it back to britain and spain .  how will loveless accomplish this ?  well , by hulking around the desert in an enormous , mechanical tarantula , of course .  bosomy dance hall girl rita escobar ( hayek ) , whose scientist father was kidnapped by loveless , joins west and gordon on their gadget-filled train .   ( gordon first discovers rita in a cage , waiting to be rescued . )  racial politics obviously prevented the filmmakers from pairing dull rita romantically with west , despite the movie's " hip " attitude toward the black thing .   ( west automatically shoots anyone who calls him a " nigger " before that person can finish speaking the word .  super . )  at any rate , i kept waiting for rita to say something humourous , but she's a walking dress-up toy .   ( her single comic moment is also the best shot of the film : she bashfully reveals bare bumcheeks through the peek-a-boo flap of her pyjamas . )  jim west is the role that finally stymied will smith , whose comic timing has always been hit or miss , as episodes of " the fresh prince of bel-air " demonstrate .  smith's a better reactor than actor , which is why he was so thoroughly engaging in men in black-he didn't start out a hero .  in wild wild west he's required to exude eastwood cool and amuse at the same time ( and from frame one ) , a difficult feat i'm not sure any living performer could pull off .  smith is ill equipped , for example , to handle the moment in which jim west performs stand-up for some rednecks at his own hanging .  what attracted sonnenfeld to this material ?  this isn't the first time he has adapted a tv show for the big screen ( the addams family , anyone ? ) , but it's the first big stinker of his career as a director .  wild wild west is poorly-paced bombast , full of doa gags ( ted levine shows up as a general who uses a gramophone horn for a hearing aid ; levine played buffalo bill in the silence of the lambs-he's too intense to get an intentional laugh ) , lousy special effects ( the bluescreening is amateurish-foregrounds are never proportionate to the backgrounds ) , and frequent illogic .   ( to wit , its ridiculous villain so badly wants jim west out of the way that he . . . drops  him onto a steel platform to do battle with some generic , ugly henchmen , instead of shooting him at point blank rage with one of the many guns on board the tarantula . )  wild wild west's bright spots , such as the cool opening credits sequence , bai ling's all-too-brief appearance as a femme fatale , or the brilliant " his master's voice " joke , are all part of the film's first half , which is more clever and enjoyable , at least , than its second .  when , towards what seemed like the end of wild wild west , gordon proposes the idea of building an airplane and west rejects it , there was a collective groan among audience members : it meant we were going to have to sit through another loud action sequence before gordon builds the glider , the invention of which would inevitably lead to the proverbial whiz-bang finale .  
well lets see . . . i'm  not quite sure how to review this film , based on its laughter factor .  well yeah i can , it's not funny .  ok so i laughed one time which warranted the 1/2 star , but other than that i sat in my seat wondering when this pos would be over , ( which at a running time of 107 minutes seemed like forever ! ) .  in fact , this could be the un-funniest movie i've seen in a long time , if not the un-funniest .  let me be the first to say " ready to rumble " is a huge disappointment .  long time wrestling lovers ( david and scott ) dream of making it to the wcw , and watching jimmy king wrestle .  that is their hero of course , whom is kicked out of the wcw .  well here is where the plot thickens ( lol ) : the two wish to rescue the king , and put him back into the wcw but not that easily , because they are being tampered with by many people who are out to get them , while david's father wants him to become a police officer , and scott is a loser who has to with the help of david clean out johnny on the spots .  what a plot eh ?   " ready to rumble " is one of those films that tries to be funny , but sadly fails miserably , everything in the film is imcomprehinsable , and even the trailer wasn't funny .  the actors are dull , the script awful , and the plot which there isn't much of . . . . really  annoying .  i'm not quite sure how great actors like these , and very funny actors too , are given such a lame script , and directed in such a childish manner , that i wonder if hollywood is ever gonna make good films these days .  this review isn't going to be very long because of the fact that there isn't much going for the film , if anything at all .  only one big laugh is in the film , which isn't all that hilarious .  i sat in my chair wondering with this 107 ( ! ! ! ! ! )  minute " comedy " was going to be over , and sadly it went on forever .  i'm not sure if anything could have saved this film from being such a total waste , but believe me you , it is .  reviewed by brandon herring 4/29/00 for more reviews please visit movie review central at http : //www . geocities . com/moviefan983/moviereviewcentral . html  
the most interesting part of " can't hardly wait " just happens to be not only the most human , but for many of us , the one part that many of us can easily relate to .  that is the character of denise ( lauren ambrose ) , the film's sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film , and at one point sits down on a couch and looks totally bored .  the film wisely holds over this moment , nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party . . . almost  too nicely .  for some members of the audience ( read : me ) , this is basically a mirror of what's going on with them watching this film .  we sit there wondering why we've even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place .  i would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this .  after all , this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high school with .  everyone's here : the jock , the homecoming queen , the nerd ( and his dominions of trekkies and x-philes ) , the alienated wannabe writer , the school spirit girl , the pothead ( s ) , the wigger , etc , etc , etc , and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial , lame , and basically as a bunch of losers .  except for denise , who rolls her eyes at everything , and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks ( her yearbook entry , something which is done for each main character , quotes oscar wilde - definite pointers there ) .  unfortunately , the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film .  the film , as i said , portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything .  however , instead of sticking with this , perhaps even going a bit further with it , they let this lie , and actually make these characters into our heroes .  we follow several of them , all a bunch of moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity and realism , and tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared and/or identified with them .  and if we did , we certainly don't want to revisit that state of being .  here's a quick low-down : it's graduation , and we follow a bunch of seniors on the last night , otherwise known as the " american grafitti " or , to a lesser extent , the " dazed and confused " cliche .  the formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly ; the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party .   " can't hardly wait " just opts for a big indoor keg party , and a little bit of aimless driving , albeit of the i'm-whining-because-i-can't-get-a-girl-i-want brand .  we follow many people around , but mostly we trail preston ( ethan embry , of " that thing you do ! " ) , the alienated writer , who's been pining over the homcoming queen , amanda ( the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt ) , for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart .  now that she's broken up with her football player boyfriend , mike ( peter facinelli ) , he decides to go to the party with a note he's written declaring his " love " for her in the hopes he'll build up the guts to give it to her . . . even  though he's leaving for a multi-week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut ( okay : the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson ? ) .  since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldn't be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film , and because it's a party , there are some more main characters , such as : william ( charlie korsmo , finally surfacing after " dick tracy " ) , the nerd ( and his dominions ) who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike , who's humiliated him for years , but gets too caught up in drinking to do it ; kenny ( seth green ) , the wigger , who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid ( uh huh ) ; and denise , the only exceptional character , who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom ( don't ask ) with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile .  ugh .  the main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not " american grafitti " or " dazed and confused , " two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers ( not to mention were extremely entertaining ) , but to john hughes films of the 80s , most notably " sixteen candles . "  the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters , and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion .  this film forgets to satirize its characters , and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes . . . and  then says that it's all okay .  we can't take this film seriously , nor can we take this as fun , so really what good is it ?  but i will tell you some things i did like : i liked the direction , except for a couple too-over-the-top features , like way-too-glossy jump cuts ( it's like an oxymoron ) and other obscurities .  generally , though , elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement , and even manage to capture an altman-esque feel to their film from time to time ( a thing with a note , though , is too hokey to really be admirable ) .  i actually did like seth green , for once in about a decade ( when he played a very young woody allen in " radio days " ) - his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable . . . almost .  and , of course , lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise , the one character we could have used some more of , even though it would have changed the entirety of the film .  however , the character of denise really doesn't work with the film , when really thought about .  she's far too witty and realized ( at least for the first half ) to belong in this film , and whenever she appears , she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone .  she's not just the cynic or the intellectual ; she's just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters .  she may ruin the film more , but at least when she's on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves " well , at least we'll be entertained . "  a couple other things that just don't work : mike's character , who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything : too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general ; the aimless , bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda - give me a break ; and perhaps the one thing that just doesn't work at all : jenna eflman's uncredited cameo as an angel - just didn't work , but nice try .  basically the worst thing about this film , the real reason i'm giving this such a low rating , is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we'd do .  we don't feel for these characters because for most of us , we aren't stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots .  the acid test for high school movies is : does it at all capture the feel of what it's portraying ?  the answer for this film is no .  nice try , though .  
georges polti once wrote a paper called " the thirty-six dramatic situations , " in which he asserted the fact that all drama could be defined by no more than thirty-six different situations .  this may be the modern restatement of the biblical prophecy from ecclesiastes , " there's nothing new under the sun . "  the faculty , the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez , certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion .  there's not a measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing .  drawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers , screenwriter kevin williamson ( of scream 2 credit ) gives us a horror tale set in middle america ( ohio ) one eventful fall .  making use of a cast of unusually stock characters , williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence day-style but rather " through the back door . "  parasitic aliens take over the faculty of a run-down high school and soon have infested most of the student body , leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day .  the lack of gusto is the movie's major stumbling block .  even though the genre has seen movies that have a lack for quality such as this , they've been saved by an energetic approach .  this casts more than a shadow of a doubt on williamson's ability , who enjoyed success with the wes craven-directed scream but couldn't pull anything solid in for this outing or i know what you did last summer .  although he designs the faculty with more of a sci-fi bent than his typical slasher picture , it still comes down to the same results : throw the stock characters in a steel cage match and see who comes out alive .  on that level , the main roles are played by virtual unknowns .  only the recognizeable elijah wood ( deep impact ) is at the front ; other than that , the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers .  perhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these up-and-comers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved ; but to do that , they'd all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty a la " dawson's creek . "  needless to say the acting is far from top notch , nor does necessity ask that it should be .  there is a moment or two of genuine horror , but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the sci-fi direction to make any use of it .  in sum , the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off .  
in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black .  sir anthony hopkins , playing a super-rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner .  his oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake .  the daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes .  hopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts .  whichever one you like , dear , he says .  and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries .  i liked that scene for two reasons .  first , the cakes looked really cool .  second , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act .  meet joe black is chock-full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot .  it's easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it's even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely ) .  the difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess .  i know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy .  case in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie .  however , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani .   ( it's not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . )  it shouldn't take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr . pitt .  and indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished .  well , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous .  so , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately .  anyway , the deceased lawyer's body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role .  the idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world .  if this weren't hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish-out-of-water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who's wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn't know how to act in our society .  it also doesn't help that the character of death is written so inconsistently .  he claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one ) .  he speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois .  he knows everything about some characters , nothing about others .  and as played by brad pitt , he's not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he's just there .  it's as if someone told pitt , " never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty . "  it's as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie .  i've used the phrase " angel of death " in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt's performance with this year's best angel performance , nicolas cage's in city of angels .  where pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows .  where cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant .  cage struck instant chemical sparks with co-star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani's character is so shallow that she can't see beyond pitt's good looks .  the movie's other top name is a much better actor , but that doesn't save meet joe black .  sir anthony hopkins isn't given much better material to work with , unfortunately .  he plays one of these good-hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood .   ( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins's character more realistically evil . )  hopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world .  of course , no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder .  but i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire .  hopkins pretty much goes to the office -- and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation .  fans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated , i'm sure .  i stayed awake all the way through meet joe black , and i'm asking myself why .  movies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest , which is what i'm going to do now .  go spend time with your family , go volunteer for a local charity , heck , go take a nap .  don't go see meet joe black , because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death .  -- curtis edmonds   " no children have ever meddled with the republican party and lived to tell about it .

plot outline - wendy ( samantha press ) , a jazz singer , loves mack ( hugo race ) a criminal and wanna be rock singer who's planning a bank heist .  mack is also being tailed by a couple of cops , one an inexperienced rookie ( dominic sweeney ) , the other ( john flaus ) a worn out veteran who frequents wendy's jazz club .  they're tailing mack , because he has an audiotape that may show evidence of governmental corruption .  meanwhile wendy's sexually awakener , fifteen year old sister ( rebecca elmaloglou ) has moved in with her , and is secretly watching mack and wendy's late night love trysts ? much zaniness ensues  the review : main problem first - about 2% of rood rock star to actor conversions in filmdom ever really work .  unfortunately , trying to cast hugo race as a violent , sexy criminal falls into the " what the hell where they thinking " category that takes up 98% of the rest .  but , hell , it's not as if he's the only problem in this well-intentioned but ultimately below average aussie thriller .  leads , race and samantha press are wooden and dull , hampered by some unfortunate attempts at sexy dialogue early on .  though they do manage some heat later in their love scenes , helped , no doubt by them keeping their mouths shut .  the film suffers every time the story shifts back to these two .  which is unfortunately , the other main story isn't any great shakes either .  the second part , concerning two cops , political corruption and that elusive tape is incredibly muddled .  at many points during the movie i had no idea what was going on , a situation that didn't improve on repeated viewing .  there is no doubt that this film's achilles heel is its script .  as for the rest of the cast , it's a mixed bag .  john flaus , one of australia's most criminally underused actors , is in top form as the withering , alcoholic jazz fan cop , who may or may not have sold out to the highest bidder .  although he falters at one point , when the script calls for him to get up on stage and deliver a drunken beat sermon , but believe me , they way it was written , no one could have pulled it off .  dominic sweeney is fine , though he seems to be uneasy in front of the lens but he really isn't given a whole lot to do .  pre home and away elmaloglou is pretty good as the inquisitive jojo , but her character seems extraneous to the story , well , at least until the final scenes .  i must admit , in too deep does have some impressive qualities , not the least of which is it visual element .  cinematographers mark gilfedder & peter zakharov have achieved the almost impossible by making melbourne look like a sweat drenched tropic city , which is akin to turning london into san paolo .  the bar is an oppressive red , like all of it's patrons are being baked while they drink , outside it hazy orange by day and cool blue by night .  if only deborah parson's script could have supported this idea better .  having two director's ( colin south & john tatoulis ) doesn't help either , the most glaring example of which is the final retribution/fight scene , where for some reason the camera pulls away from the onscreen action , and more importantly it doesn't pull away to anything else .  it just stays static as the fight happens in the distance .  it has no reason to it ; it's just bad direction .  and , ultimately , that is what sums up in too deep , it's tries to be good , and you want it to work , but , it's just lacking the talent behind it , that it needs to succeed .  
this is crap , but , honestly , what older american audience is going to be able to resist seeing jack lemmon and james garner as bicker- ing ex-presidents ?  especially when their supporting players in- clude dan aykroyd as the current commander in chief , lauren bacall as a former first lady , and john heard as the dan quayle-ish vice president .  yup , you're talkin' pre-sold property here and , for warner brothers , the perfect fit into their now-ritual grumpy old men holiday slot .  for the non-discriminating viewer , my fellow americans is fine .  the raw star power alone will have audiences applauding this atrocious political- thriller road-comedy .   ( they did in mine , heaven help us . )  for the rest of us , the movie is immediately tiresome .  the tone is terrible and the banter is worse .  forget wit-- lemmon and garner merely exchange profanities through most of the movie .   ( has anyone counted the number of first penis references ? )  sure , some of the bits are absurdly funny , including a men's room macarena joke , the appearance of an elvis impersonator on a trainload of tarheels , and an all dorothy marching band performing " over the rainbow " at a gay men's march .  the get there from here , though , you have to submit to one of the most offensively overbearing musical scores of all time .  judas priest , is there a single moment of silence in this film ?  even the dialogue gets drowned out .  what a waste .  
bad movies described as " a swift descent into sinful pleasure , decay , and debauchery " are hard to watch .  bad 2000's movies that resemble bad 1980s films are even harder to watch .  shadow hours falls into the latter category , a mish-mashed train wreck of b-movie actors ( including michael dorn , aka star trek's worf ) , an uninteresting plot , vain attempts at capitalizing on the " underground " scenes of seedy los angeles , and really , really bad directing and horrendous music video-esque ballistic editing that was taught to me in film school right before i decided to drop out .  the film revolves around the life of michael holloway ( balthazar getty ) who is trying to restart his life with his one-dimensional wife chloe ( rebecca gayheart ) after a nasty bout of drug and alcohol addictions .  michael takes a job of working the graveyard shift at the local gas station and is bombarded by the ugliness and weirdness of the nightlife of l . a . one night , he meets a strange gent named stuart ( mr . buckaroo banzai , peter weller ) .  he drives a porsche , smokes french cigarettes , and drones on about life , eventually coaxing mike into exploring the " underbelly " of l . a . together , a tour of punk bars , s&m clubs , and bare-knuckle fights .  the film then throws in a murder mystery with a cop played peter greene , acting like he wants to get the chance at a reprisal of his role in the mask 2 . the film then simply dissolves into a cheap rip-off of dante's inferno mixed with an old stephen j . cannell television pilot .  the pace of the film is jarring and utterly without focus .  other horrors include the endless montages of people pumping gas and the charlie sheen , johnny depp , richard grieco-esque acting of balthazar getty .  peter weller clearly knows his career is completely gone and doesn't give two shits about it .  and after the cheap exploitation of bondage clubs , dance clubs , and brothels - damn , isn't anyone safe any more from the ugly eye of hollywood ! ?  way back in 1984 , a great but crazy director named abel ferrara made his worse film and called it fear city .  shadow hours reminds me of an almost perfect sequel .  director/writer : isaac eaton producers : peter alevey , andrea mia , shon greenblatt , balthazar getty starring : balthazar getty , peter weller , rebecca gayheart , peter greene , frederic forrest , brad douriff , michael dorn  
robin williams has the rarest of gifts : the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style .  overwhelmingly , his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best ( with the notable exception of flubber ) .  so when i , the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams , tell you that not even williams can save his latest project , you know it's in trouble .  jakob the liar is a confused , muddled little movie ; a generically " uplifting " film with a fundamental contradiction : the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie doesn't realize it .  williams plays jakob haim , a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii .  one night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of a high-ranking german officer for his punishment .  jakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a radio broadcast .  the announcement ( in english , but punctuated by a triumphant " heil hitler ! " ) is that russian troops are only miles away from jakob's ghetto .  liberation ! he thinks .  the next day , jakob tells the news to his closest friend , a volatile prize fighter named misha ( liev schreiber ) , who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along .  soon , it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his home -- a crime punishable by death .  this is absurdly false , but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this , the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate .  the danger , of course , is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto , and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger .  in a curiously irrelevant subplot , jakob finds a 11-year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home .  apparently he is afraid that she will be discovered , and goes to great length to make sure of that -- just why the idea frightens him is never made clear .  he and the girl build an uninvolving , generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning .  the moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine .  but jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false .  such hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations aren't met , the results are far worse than if there was no hope .  that's the film's biggest detriment : it is based on a false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false .  it's never moving because it doesn't give us anything to be moved by .  jakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing .  robin williams doesn't inject the film with life , as a matter of fact , he seems a little out of it , as if crippled by his fake accent .  he is stragely unenthusiastic ; his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless , hopeless .  not since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent ; this isn't the robin williams we know and love .  in good will hunting he became a serious actor and won an oscar for it .  here , he is more of a wannabe serious actor ; an impostor .  jakob the liar will be compared with last year's life is beautiful because it is being marketed as a " holocaust comedy " .  it's not a comedy .  it tries , sometimes , but it rarely works .  is it a melodrama ?  a war movie ?  a character study ?  no , no , and no .  jakob the liar is the kind of movie that can't be placed into a category ; not because it covers so many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it attempts .  
when the haunting arrived in theaters , all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects .  while i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department , i don't think that they are completely to blame for this movie's failure .  it appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the " unseen " terrors , and it was about as scary as a dust bunny .  so special effects or not , if the story isn't the least bit scary , you aren't going to end up with a very frightening movie .  the thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern .  dern is always great , and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie .  as i sat through the seemingly endless , albeit fairly impressive , special effects , i kept wishing that this movie was about dern's caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast .  never a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie .  liam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear .  he decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion .  he tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia .  and he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings-on .  catherine zeta-jones , lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects .  like the original , taylor's character is the star of the movie .  but since she doesn't quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms . zeta-jones , their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original .  and let's face it , probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta-jones .  i'll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren't in it .  but the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets .  they take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients .  there really isn't much of a story here .  just endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with .  and the special effects are great .  in many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere .  in other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the " cool shots " quota .  at no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary -- funny , maybe .  but not scary .  then we have the set .  when i first saw the house , i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it .  but it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did , and decided to take the idiotically overdone route .  this included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves .  what part did these rooms play in the story ?  absolutely none .  they were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie .  then we have the actors .  lili taylor has never been one of my favorites .  and when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in , she comes in around the average or slightly below mark .  i have no idea why liam neeson took this role .  he basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus .  his character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him .  i have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman .  zeta-jones was cast because she is too hot for words .  the fact that her character is bi-sexual is just icing on the cake .  all catherine has to do in this movie is look good .  fortunately that is something she does very well .  while she does have a fairly good size part , it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eye-candy .  it's too bad someone of her talents wasted them here .  any random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role .  the haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999's horror movies , the blair witch project .  the haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget , while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares .  both prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film .  if the story sucks , it's all downhill from there .  my advice ?  if you are looking for special effects , go rent star wars .  if it's scares you want , rent halloween .  either way , it's probably in your best interests to skip the haunting .  
what's to like about the world of extremely violent trash pornography--ie .  the garbage known as " snuff " films ?  nothing , right ?  what's to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography ?  well . . . nothing .  so , why make it , hollywood ?  there's no reason why the average , sane movie-goer will be interested in such a topic .  no one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this .  the lack of quality filmmaking in " 8mm " ( from technical to acting ) stands out even more when you consider the star , writer , and supporting cast--all reputable .  but joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again !  like paul schrader , schumacher has his moments , but they're few and far ( far ! )  between .  basically , this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it .  why not walk out ?  well , this wouldn't be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie .  here's why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of " 8mm " . . .  first thing--if you don't heed my advice , then understand what you're about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud .  it's not easy to watch .  i didn't know the details of the story beforehand , but at least my ignorance can help others now .  the ( ha ! ) plot revolves around tom welles ( nicolas cage ) as a surveillance expert and private investigator .  a rich old woman discovers a " snuff " film in her late husband's safe .  she calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl ( it had to be a young girl , didn't it , schumacher ! ) who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead .  she's horrified that her husband would have owned such a film ( in 8mm , of course ) and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find .  family-man welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque " murder " .  let me backtrack for a moment .  see , " snuff " films are pornos with a violent twist--people are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead .  however , the deaths are often staged and , in those cases , special effects and " good " acting make all the difference .  very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hard-to-find movies .  the thought of this " industry " makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review , but i'll swallow my bile and move on .  welles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry .  you'd think he's sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him !  he comes across smut clerk max ( joaquin phoenix ) who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze .  after a lot of digging and bribing , welles finds the men who are responsible for making this , and other , " snuff " films .  skip ahead , skip ahead , skip ahead . . .  led by dino velvet ( peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance ) and star-torturer " machine " ( christopher bauer ) , they have a big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue .  the movie doesn't end there , unfortunately , because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films do--become a vigilante .  this film doesn't draw you in .  it keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close ?  it is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ( ie .   " se7en " ) , but it takes a large measure of restraint ( schumacher has none ) and a larger amount of talent ( schumacher has little ) .  by those jabs , i'm not only referring to his stylish destruction of the " batman " franchise , but " a time to kill " was an immensely overrated disappointment .  for a guy who gets so much studio money , his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled .  a good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter .  writer andrew kevin walker didn't recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for '95s twisted thriller , " se7en " .  director schumacher doesn't have that innate ability to make you watch things you don't really want to see like better directors are capable of doing .  he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we don't see is more frightening than what we do ( especially when it's a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered ) .  however , gratuitous is joel's middle name .  he must think that not flaunting a hard-core act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint .  no , he doesn't go that far , but we see enough unpleasantness .  he doesn't leave much to the imagination .  it's manipulating to hurt ( or kill ) young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante .  the script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters , yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ( ha ha ! )  craft .  case in point , a shot of a christian fellowship bus ( good , right ? )  drives away to reveal one of the villains ( bad , right ? ) .  see . . . no  subtlety .  does joel think we're stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery ?  who do we root for in this mess ?  is there anybody out there ?  it's not all the director's fault , though .  why did the actors sign up for this ?  nicolas cage is an oscar-winner , for cryin' out loud !  if he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money , what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda ?  what is cage supposed to be in this movie--a whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears ?  villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy .  and what is james gandolfini doing in this trash ?  he was so solid as a concerned father in " a civil action " .  i guess ol' nic , pete , and jim were promised a mountain of money . . . or  they're suckers .  or they just don't care .  there are moments ( albeit brief ones ) where this rises above the wasteland .  catherine keener is good ( although too quick to threaten divorce ) as mrs . wells .  baby cindy is obviously cute and wells' devout love of his daughter is sweet .  the mother ( amy norton ) of the girl in the infamous 8mm film is not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter .  this film has an appropriate blue-toned , washed-out look like " payback " ( which was a much better movie ) .  the editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue , but at other times it's rough .  during some conversations , close-ups and wide shots are not cut very well , making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts aren't good and whose timing was a half-second off .  such a technical error indeed stands out .  speaking of standing out , don't believe the misleading trailers .  there's not much action here .  occasionally , yes , but not as often as your tv will have you believe .  after seeing " 8mm " , i may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again .  is that a positive ?  well , if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing a dirty movie again is their motive , they've done a swell job here .  it'll be a long time before i give a schumacher film another chance--unless i lose my mind and become seriously depraved .  but today i'm not depraved , so i ask , why does this film preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it ?  i'm sure that somewhere right now there's some pretty sick crap going on , but that doesn't mean i need to know about it .  yes , mr . walker , your script tells us that there are some screwed-up folks out there .  yes , mr . walker , the proverbial monster doesn't look like we expect him to .  you said all that in 1995 .  move on .  this film serves no purpose .  it doesn't entertain , it doesn't teach us anything , it doesn't make a statement beyond the obvious " this stuff is bad " approach .  only if this film awakens the authorities to find a way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile .  that's not likely to happen , though , so " 8mm " is indeed a scummy waste of money .  orson welles said years ago in a tribute to film , " to movies . . . to  good movies " .  if only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in a hole .  like " snuff " films , " 8mm " should never have been made .  now , excuse me while i go try to forget i ever saw it .  useless trivia--joel schumacher loves the vigilante theme .  he used it in " batman forever " , in " batman & robin " , in " a time to kill " , in " falling down " , and it's rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow . . .  
the best thing -- in fact , the only good thing -- i can say about dark city is that it made me want to go see l . a . confidential again .  or go rent body heat , to see william hurt do some real noir .  or even -- god help me -- palmetto .  alex proyas's new movie screams atmosphere .  i screamed , too , " get me out of this theater ! "  new line cinema spent millions of dollars creating the expressionistic film noir visuals and paying the actors , and doesn't have any way to get it back .  i paid $4 . 25 for a matinee screening and don't have any way to get my money back , either .  you'll hear a lot from other critics about the look and feel of this movie .  i will admit that the cinematographers and costume designers and set artists and cgi graphics geeks all worked hard to create a stunning , nightmarish future world where it's always a late night in 1948 , complete with rotary phones and automats and fedoras .  i've got news for you fellows -- i don't care how hard you worked , or how visually stunning this movie looks -- you wasted your time and mine , working on a movie without a plot , without a clear sense of direction of where it wanted to go , without a soul or a reason to care .  the movie starts out oh-so-promising .  john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) is lying in a bathtub in the sort of seedy hotel that in real life , would have been boarded up long ago .  there is a dead , mutilated prostitute in the other room -- a surprise , as he has lost his memory .  the phone rings : it's a sinister-sounding man , claiming to be his doctor , telling him to flee for his life .  all well and good , right ?  wrong .  apparently , someone decided that the audience was just a bit too dim to figure out the intricacies of the plot .   ( this is getting to be a popular assumption in hollywood . )  so , the actual beginning of the movie is not sewell running for his life , rather , it's a voice-over narration by the aforementioned doctor ( keifer sutherland ) explaining exactly what is going on and who is responsible .  it's as though sam the piano player had told us that rick and ilsa had been getting it on in paris in the first three minutes of casablanca .  no , wait , that's not fair to casablanca .  it's more like watching a new plotline at the first of the show -- or if you want to know how i really feel , having an off-screen narrator explain that gilligan won't be getting off the island in this episode .  >from here , the coherence of the plot goes down faster than ( insert monica lewinsky joke here ) .  the characters just wander around the city aimlessly and bump into each other for no apparent reason , and that's what moves the plot .  what we're left with is a string of unanswered questions that don't make any sense .  we're given aliens with unlimited omnipotent powers , yet they forget to use them at critical moments and get themselves killed .  we're given a hero who can " tune " into these same powers , yet he only uses them when it's convenient to the plot .  we're given a whole long list of loose ends that go nowhere  usually , critics will say that an actor playing an underwritten part " isn't given much to do . "  in this movie , no one is given anything to do .  sewell is given the impossible role of a man who doesn't remember anything , and plays it like . . .  um . . .  a man who doesn't remember anything .  the aliens are tall , pasty-faced , and bald , and wear long black cloaks and fedoras to remind us that they're evil -- and there's a child alien as well , straight out of an anne rice novel .  sutherland is saddled with a limp , a twitchy eye , and a breathy accent to remind us that he's in league with the aliens .  to its credit , dark city boasts two impressive bits of casting .  william hurt is perfectly cast as the world-weary inspector charged with catching the man who is murdering prostitutes all over the city .  jennifer connelly , playing sewell's love interest , is given two all-too-brief moments on screen as a lounge singer -- and turns in the sexiest performace this side of jessica rabbit .  but instead of the dogged policeman and the femme fatale given central treatment in the script ( the way they would be in any self-respecting noir movie ) they're almost tangiential to the plot , such as it is .  the problem with dark city is this : it's a bad science fiction movie pretending to be film noir .  the essence of film noir isn't , as proyas seems to beleive , breathy dialogue or snap-brim fedoras or tall , bald evil villains who would make peter lorre curl up in a corner .  dark city has not one bit of intrigue , moral ambiguity , suspense , or anything else that keeps us coming back to the noir classics .  dark city is like the intricately carved door that kate winslet floats on in titanic .  it's an exceptionlly well-made and intricately designed piece of flotsam , sailing around and around the middle of the ocean , going nowhere .  
stephen , please post if appropriate .   " mafia ! " - crime isn't a funny business by homer yen ( c ) 1998  on a particular night when i found myself having some free time , i had a chance to either go to sleep early or to see " mafia ! " , a spoof of mafia and crime films such as " the godfather , " " goodfellas " and " casino " .  at 84 minutes in length , i thought that i could enjoy a few laughs before getting a good nights sleep .  but by my account , i think that my laff-o-meter only registered a few grins , one giggle , and maybe one chortle .  i suppose that you could justify your time as homage to the venerable hollywood star , lloyd bridges , who just recently passed away and whose last performance was in this film .   " mafia ! "  chronicles vincenzo cortino's ( lloyd bridges ) life .  separated from his family when he was young , he escapes to america and tries to live an honest life .  but as fate would have it , vincenzo grows up to be a powerful and klutzy crime lord .  following in his footsteps are his two sons , joey ( billy burke ) and anthony ( jay mohr ) .  like all siblings in powerful crime families , they squabble over power , the future of the family , fortune , and women .   " mafia ! " is co-written by jim abrahams , who also contributed to some gut-busting funny spoofs such as " airplane " and " the naked gun . "  but these previous movies were funny because the jokes seemed more universally understood and there was more of a manic silliness at work .  as i write this , i also wonder how many people have actually seen the movies on which this spoof is based .  crime movies in general contain a lot of profanity and violence .  it's a tough genre to parody .  i was kind of hoping that they could somehow spoof the profanity used in all of those crime movies , maybe by having all of the tough crime lords say " please " as they decide which sector to take over , but this opportunity was never explored .  there were one or two moments that made me smile such as the scene where vincenzo is dancing with his newly wed daughter-in-law .  a gunman shoots him several times .  the impact of the bullets cause him to make these wild contortions that force the wedding band to change music styles to keep up with him , from the samba to disco to the macarena .  i think that i just gave away the best part of the film .  oh well , that just means that you can go to sleep a little earlier .  
robin williams is a comedic genus .  that is , he is one when he's in a film that allows him space to move .   " flubber " straps him in a straitjacket , covers him with duct tape , stuffs him in a coat closet and piles furniture against the door to make sure that he doesn't get out .  in a re-make of its own 1961 " absent minded professor " , disney offers us proof that more is definitely less .  recycling old films ( " that darned cat " , " 101 dalmatians " ) dressed up as new is the newest money machine from the home of the mouse that roared .  professor phillip brainard ( williams ) is a terminally forgetful scientist teaching at a small college .  his fiancee , sara jean reynolds ( marcia gay harden ) , president of the college is none too happy with him because he's left her waiting at the altar due to his lack of short-term -- and long-term -- memory .  she's giving him one more chance .  he blows that chance when he invents " flubber " ( flying rubber ) and is so excited by his discovery that sara jean is once again awaiting him in her white dress .  his tardiness is helped along by his jealous flying robotic assistant who wants him all to herself .  it's not all bad news .  flubber is a green jello that can magnify and reflect energy that is applied to it .  brainard realizes the commercial potential within the goo can save the school from bankruptcy and being taken over by the town's evil industrialist charles hoenicker ( raymond barry ) .  while he's busy with his new breakthrough , the slighted sweetheart is being wooed by his sleazy rival wilson croft ( christopher mcdonald ) .  there's a flying car , flubber-enhanced basketball game and an assortment of broken lab equipment : none of which are the least bit interesting or funny .  at one point , my son looked around the audience and asked " why are these people laughing ? "  although williams turns in one of his least inspired roles , he is easily the most lively of the actors .  everyone else comes across as half-asleep .  the re-make is successful in that respect .  it feels like a bad disney movie from the sixties .  i remember the original as being charming , but my guess is that the memory from almost four decades ago has been artificially enhanced by the years .  there have been some updates .  fred macmurray's flying model t has been replaced by a t-bird .  his faithful dog charlie is now " weebo " , the hovering robot .  the biggest change is that , with sophisticated computer animation , we now can have films show off special effects without being at all entertaining .  flubber is anthropomorphized into a being supposedly with personality .  the gloop has little arms and legs and splits into tiny little gloopettes for a big dance number .  this has nothing to do with the story .  the only possible reason is to create merchandising opportunities so that kids can badger their parents into taking them to mcdonalds for the toys .  not that contributing little to the plot is a big problem .  there are very few aspects of the film that move the story and those that do don't make sense .  the discovery of flubber is going to save the college because brainard can sell his flying car to ford .  anyone with half a brain would be able to see that his intelligent flying automaton is worth billions .  it's unbelievable that his lover ( well , probably not a lover -- after all this is disney ) starts dating croft after the aborted wedding .  there's not one appealing component of this man .  after the professor discovers that smearing a golf ball with the gunk causes it to bounce uncontrollably around his lab wreaking havoc , i cringed as he picked up a bowling ball .  this guy is beyond forgetful , venturing into the certifiable .  co-writer john hughes used to direct light-weight but thoughtful teen films .  the care behind " pretty in pink " and " the breakfast club " all went out the window after his " home alone " franchise heated up the box offices .  looking much like " home alone 3 1/2 " , " flubber " even features a couple of vapid goons who get banged around and a cute little boy who screams a lot .  in some ways , it's difficult to judge this film .  i have a suspicion that i'm not it's target audience .  after all , i measure my age in two digits .  
mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla .  his entrance , however , is a grand one : out from the trees he leaps , gargantuan and imposing , sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug , and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have .  joe bellows at the poachers before him , angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars .  during this scene , i turned to my friend and said , " wow .  that's some ape . "  joe is quite a gorilla -- a big , digital gorilla .  he runs around the fields , chasing cars and people .  he picks things up and stares at them pensively .  he breaks things on accident , because he's just too big to avoid clumsiness .  joe , as a special effect , is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes .  as a character , he doesn't quite register .  and the story he's been put in is as limp as they come .  the words " family entertainment " have never been a stamp of quality , but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart .  the picture is a remake of the 1949 film .  it's mostly just about the big gorilla , but , strictly as a formality , the movie also has a few human characters .  the main one is jill young ( poor charlize theron , forced to waste her talent ) , a lover of gorillas .  as a child , she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother ; now , she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife .  specifically , she's out to protect joe , a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood .  soon , zoologist gregg o'hara ( bill paxton ) discovers joe ; he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser ( rade sherbedgia ) , who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill's mother .  so , in an effort to save joe , jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve , where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers .  in addition , the space is way too small for him ( after all , he is a really big gorilla ) .  and , to add to the complications , strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext ( he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe ) , and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill's mother .  jill , of course , doesn't recognize strasser , even though he did kill her mother .  this is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young , a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film .  the movie isn't really offensive -- it has some competent actors , a few nifty sets , and a lot of scenes with a big , digitized gorilla .  but the story is really dumb , there aren't any characters , and the film isn't satisfying on any level beyond its visuals .  the movie also has bad dialogue .  if a critic says that a film has bad dialogue , it's only fair to quote some of it , but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like " joe isn't happy ! "  and " joe isn't safe here ! "   " we need to get joe out of here ! "   " joe is way too big for that cage ! "  i don't know if these phrases are word for word , but they're close .  as i said , the characters here are only present as a formality : they do little more than state the obvious ( of * course * joe is too big for that cage ) .  paxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them .  sadly , mighty joe young wastes them both .  there are a few clever moments ( although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment ) , and , as i said , the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes .  it's certainly not a bad film for kids ; i doubt joe will give them nightmares .  but adults in the audience aren't likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla .  a big gorilla is only interesting for a little while ; after that , something needs to be done with the big gorilla .  nobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla .  
retrospective : city of the living dead ( 1980 )  a film review by mike watson copyright 1997 mike watson  i once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as " dim-witted " .  and by golly , just about all other words fail me when confronted with a dog like city of the living dead .  although the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career , this is not one of them .  two points in the movie's favour - the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi - keep things from falling totally into the abyss , but by and large city of the living dead is a failure .  and like most cinematic failures , it comes down to bad writing , dumb performances and lousy direction .  the story starts in new york when , during a seance , a medium ( katherine mccoll ) sees a vision of a priest hanging himself in the town of dunwich , massachusetts .  for reasons we won't go into here , this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth .  the medium apparently dies of fright during the seance , but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by a crusty old journalist ( christopher george ) .  that scene in itself is a howler : why would you bust open a coffin with a large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside ?  and don't cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before they're buried ?  anyway , off the two of them go to dunwich to save the world , where various grisly goings-on are already happening as all saints day approaches .  fulci's graphic gore is in evidence once again , but here it only serves to further highlight the film's flimsy script and plodding direction .  the dialogue , in all manner of speaking , is unspeakable .  not bad in the quotable sense , like an ed wood film , but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious " lets explain the plot " type approach .  mccoll doesn't have a clue who her character is : deadly serious one minute , frivolous the next , she at times is genuinely hard to watch .  and the geezer ( the actor's name escapes me ) who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach than mccoll as the film progresses .  christopher george's performance is salvageable , but he gets his brains ripped out in the end by a zombie and we don't care .  in fact we don't care for anyone in city of the living dead , though in other fulci films that hasn't mattered so much when he was on form as a stylist and an ideas man , as he was in the beyond .  as a director , some of fulci' idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly and annoying here .  he constantly uses extreme close-ups of people's eyes , a ridiculous technique which suggests an attempt to convey the emotion that his dialogue and actors aren't capable of .  and despite some gruesome violence , he barely manages a single scare in the entire film .  long-time collaborator fabio frizzi , talented but always erratic , offers a patchy soundtrack that veers between eerie , gothic death marches and woefully inappropriate electro-pop that's quite frankly embarrassing .  fulci's other films of this period may be flawed - house by the cemetery , the beyond , the black cat - but they are nonetheless films with more inspiration , atmosphere and better dialogue than this turkey .  for completists only .  
forget get carter .  instead . . .  get me a cup of coffee .  what the hell has happened to all good american action movies ?  did i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere ?  when did all of the bad-ass , kicking butt and taking names , gun-toting , crazed , vengeful characters of the 1980's -- from such films as commando , cobra , predator , raw deal , first blood -- suddenly turn into innocent , compassionate , sensitive , teary-eyed knuckleheads .  the only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east -- and i don't mean new york city .  get carter -- the latest masterpiece from uber-thespian sylvester stallone -- is a prime example of large and in charge 80's action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown .  stallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up .  a few years ago , stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey .  that role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland -- a strange film about redemption within a broken soul .  stallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past .  too bad get carter returns stallone to action , but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges .  get carter is a simple story .  stallone plays frank carter , a vegas bruiser for a loan shark ( played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore ) .  when frank's brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident , frank , feeling all guilty and mushy inside , thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented " carter's way " .  he talks tough with his brother's wife , lends a helping had to his brother's daughter doreen ( rachel leigh cook ) , and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee .  carter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultra-cool , mcqueen-esque mickey rourke , a multi-millionaire computer geek ( alan cumming ) , and a strange foreign guy ( michael caine ) who speaks in riddles and talks tough .  carter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties .  what a minute !  this sounds just like another film i saw last year , the limey .  better not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off .  actually , get carter is a remake of the 1971 british production of the same name , starring caine in the title role ( and what with his cameo here , the cleverness is astonishing ) .  while stallone still carries his own weight here , the movie lacks what the original did as well : purpose .  throughout the film , stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough , while nobody is taking him seriously .  his one-liners fall flat , and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions , mental and physical , required of his character .  there is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations -- in both fists and words .  the biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke .  an amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs , spousal abuse , a boxing career , and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way , rourke still brings a dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character .  he may not win any oscars , but he still ranks highly in my book .  get carter has great directing , strong acting by rourke and caine , and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud .  the only thing it lacks - as with most hollywood productions -- is a good script and proper casting .  never mind that it should never have been made at all .  
when i arrived in paris in june , 1992 , i was surprised to find france plastered with posters twin peaks : fire walk with me , since the movie wasn't scheduled to open in the u . s . until late august .  happily , the film--the prequel to david lynch's cult television series--was playing in a fancy , thx theater .  unfortunately , the theater was far more impressive than the movie , which absolutely stinks , much like a french lavatory .  worse , actually .  fire walk with me ( directed by lynch ) will be completely incomprehensible to anyone who has not seen the tv series or read " laura palmer's secret diary . "  for " twin peaks " junkies , like me , the movie is only marginally improved .  the plot is jumbled and illogical , not to mention excruciatingly sluggish .  the first 30 minutes , which have almost nothing to do with the main story line , feature chris isaak and kiefer sutherland as fbi agents investigating a murder in portland , oregon .  the movie then stops in philadelphia for a nonsensical cameo by david bowie and a brief appearance by kyle maclachlan as dale cooper .  lynch then drops this plot strand altogether and abruptly shifts the setting to twin peaks , washington--one year later .  ah , twin peaks : " familiar territory , " you think to yourself as angelo badalamenti's distinctive musical score chimes in .  wrong !  the movie proves that you really can't go home again , or at least lynch can't .  only about a quarter of the characters from the tv series appear in the movie : leland palmer , bobby briggs , james , shelly , leo , the log lady and a few others--mostly in meaningless cameos .  the rest of the " twin peaks " cast is nowhere to be seen , and consequently , lynch fails to recreate the spirit and flavor of tv's most enigmatic town .  cast members michael ontkean , sherilyn fenn , piper laurie , and richard beymer are sorely missed , not to mention lara flynn boyle , who has been replaced by lackluster moira kelly in the crucial role of donna .  the movie concentrates solely on laura palmer ( sheryl lee ) as she suffers through drug abuse , prostitution , and incest , during her miserable last seven days on earth .  the night of laura's death , which is truly terrifying , is the film's only remotely effective sequence .  we finally get to see exactly what happened to laura after she jumped off james' motorcycle and ran into the woods at that lonely traffic light in the middle of nowhere .  her murder unfolds just as agent cooper reconstructed it in the tv series , which is gratifying for faithful " twin peaks " viewers .  but it's an awfully small reward for sitting through a painfully awful movie .  
an experience like baby geniuses can have certain effects on an average moviegoer .  you may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified piece of garbage , which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause you to ponder it's hollywood existence .  when i think of the screenwriters behind this film , i picture a room full of monkeys .  the monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while scratching themselves .  all of the monkeys combine their efforts , hop in a cab and take the finished product downtown to director bob clark's office .  the designated monkey explains the plot by jumping up and down on clark's desk while flailing his arms and shrieking .  the director appears to be deep in thought , until he slams his fist down on the desktop and exclaims `i love it ! ! ! '  the writing behind this project is embarrassing .  for your amusement , i will explain the plot .  dr . kinder ( kathleen turner ) and dr . heep ( christopher lloyd ) are two of the cold-hearted executives at the baby geniuses institute , where peculiar studies are going on .  as the story goes , there is an ancient myth explaining that babies ( ages 2 and under ) know all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences .  when they move past this phase , they become like any other drooling toddler .  kinder and heep want to unlock the secrets using their test babies , namely little sylvester ( sly for short ) , who can break in or out of any given situation so efficiently that he would be right at home on the mission : impossible team .  there is so much crap derived from this premise , despite the fact it's virtually identical to the plot in look who's talking !   ( a far superior film in any league ) .  you will be able to determine the quality of the film by examining the opening scene .  sylvester has broken out and managed to elude several security guards with his amazing intellect and kung-fu tactics .  question : it's obvious the babies are super-smart , but why are they able to fight like jackie chan ? ?  the adults in this film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers .  it's a shock when writers will stoop this low just to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes' familiar home alone formula .  i also found it disturbing that the babies in this film have attitude and endless 90's knowledge , quoting numerous movies and insulting their adult captors .  the effects in baby geniuses ( similar to the talking animals in babe ) are pathetic , the editing is a disaster , and the jokes are never funny .  the only reason viewers may avoid vomiting is the argument that the babies are `cute' .  i suppose they are .  i can admit to smiling a few times because the babies were cute .  other instances , though , i was howling in laughter due to the inane stupidity of the script .  there are supporting characters who have no personality whatsoever ; their entire existence is based on punch lines .  peter macnicol and kim cattrall , as an unwilling couple who have adopted sylvester's twin , are both miscast .  then again , i don't suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid .  meanwhile , dom deluise plays a fellow who gets hit in the crotch with a monkey wrench ( hahaha ) .  i would avoid baby geniuses at all costs .  instead of watching this , i would recommended filling your bathtub with cement and going snorkeling .  or perhaps you would consider going diving in shark-infested waters .  anything to avoid this painful movie .  the final line in the film , spoken by the bratty sylvester , is `if they think i'm doing the sequel for less than $20 mill , they're nuts' .  sequel ?  please have mercy .  
one of my brother's favorite movies is h . b . halicki's 1974 cult flick " gone is sixty seconds , " one of the best products of the car-chase genre that provided drive-in fare during the 1970's .  chase pics had more tire squeals than dialogue , but they had a strong visceral appeal .  although it boasts a bigger budget and familiar stars , the remake of " gone in sixty seconds " is relatively weak and dull .  randall " memphis " raines ( nicolas cage ) is a retired car thief who runs a go-cart track .  he got out of crime so that his younger brother kip ( giovanni ribisi ) would not take up boosting cars .  however , kip became a thief anyway , and now he's in big trouble .  kip promised to deliver fifty luxury and sports cars to gangster raymond calitri ( christopher eccleston ) by the end of the week .  calitri expects memphis to fulfill kip's bargain ; if he doesn't come through , kip dies .  memphis gathers his old crew ( angelina jolie , robert duvall , will patton , chi mcbride , and vinnie jones ) , and kip brings his boys ( t . j .  cross , william lee scott , scott caan , and james duval ) .  as if calitri breathing down their necks wasn't bad enough , the team is pursued by a cop ( delroy lindo ) who's still ticked off that he never busted memphis and by a rival gangster ( rap star master p ) who wants to take over calitri's clients .  watching " gone , " i discovered that stealing fifty cars is not any more interesting than stealing one .  maybe that's why the first forty-nine are fairly easy , and the thrills are saved for " eleanor , " a 1967 shelby gto , a model that has always eluded memphis .  but the big chase doesn't live up to the long wait .  i had high hopes for " gone " because it is director dominic sena's second film .   " kalifornia , " his 1993 debut , was a brilliant study in the relationship between violence and its audience .  in that movie sena took a simple thriller plot ( a couple gives a serial killer a ride ) and successfully endowed it with deeper significance .  in " gone " he seems to be aiming for a drama about two brothers who can't communicate with each other , but that goal just doesn't mesh with this plot .   " gone " either takes itself too seriously or not seriously enough .  it's not light enough to be fun , or mean enough to be intense .  this chaser has more dialogue than tire squeals but is none the better for it .  the lack of action is a waste of the premise , which should have challenged the filmmakers to create the most spectacular car chases ever .  the weak script is a waste of a talented cast .  in a " newsweek " interview last year , sean penn blasted his old pal nic cage for making bad movies .  much as i like cage , for every good picture he does ( " leaving las vegas , " " bringing out the dead " ) , there are two major stinkers ( " snake eyes , " " con air , " " 8mm , " " city of angels " ) .  that ratio is probably better than what a lot of his peers can boast , but cage has real talent .  it's a shame to waste it in glitzy , superficial tripe like " gone in 60 seconds . "  
the rapid-fire formula that worked so well in airplane ! , the " police squad ! "  television series , top secret ! , three naked gun films , and two hot shots !  movies has finally reached a desperate dead-end with spy hard .  even ezio gregio's the silence of the hams is arguably funnier than this over-extended spy- and action-movie spoof .  leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd-40 , who returns from retirement to battle his old nemesis , general rancor ( a cackling andy griffith ) .  the jokes fly in every direction and with hardly a hint of restraint , timing , or tact .  most the movie is comprised of recycled airplane and naked gun gags , recreated movie sequences , and soggy star cameos .  yeah , maybe we * do * need ray charles driving an l . a . bus bound for a speed bump , but did mr . t , hulk hogan , and dr . joyce brothers also have to appear in the same movie ?  leslie nielsen plays it straight with his usual dopey flair .  there is something oddly inspiring about the sight of nielsen wearing a nun's habit , even the resulting sister act spoof is silly .  as are the bits directly lifted from home alone , pulp fiction , true lies , etc . etc . ( adolescent males might enjoy this mess , tho .  the butt shots , breast peeks , penis pokes , flatulence gags , and related innuendo are right up beavis and butthead's alley . )  beyond the hilarious title sequence with " weird " al yankovich performing the theme song , spy hard is barely the stock that it's printed on .  my recommendation : duck in while you're waiting for another movie to start .  stay long enough to see the camera dart inside of weird al's nostril and then leave .  you won't miss a thing .  
 " marie couldn't talk , " paulie , the parrot star of his own movie , tells us about the daughter in his original family .   " dad couldn't listen .  and mom couldn't cope , so they got rid of me . "  paulie , the autobiography of a talking , not merely a mimicking , parrot , has jay mohr in the lead role of the bird - the voice , not the body - and as the minor character of benny , a small-time crook who uses paulie to pull off small scams like stealing twenties from atms .  as the parrot , mohr is delightful when director john roberts allows him to cut up .  benny , on the other hand , is a character you've seen a thousand times before , and mohr brings nothing new to that role .  roberts's deliberately slow pacing of laurie craig's script lends a subtle sweetness to its humor but creates some definite problems .  when a kids' movie wants to mosey along , watch out .  if the material is not crisp and perfectly composed , beauty can sometimes dissolve into tedium .  so it is with paulie .  when they let their bird do his stand-up comedy routines , the show hums and the audience roars .  too often , however , a sleepy silence ensues among the viewers as they wait for the story to pickup again .  tony shalhoub , the smart-mouthed chef from big night , plays misha , a recent russian immigrant to the u . s . he had been a teacher of literature at home , but now he makes his living as a janitor in the animal research lab to which paulie has been taken for study .  although misha gets a few nice lines ( " i'm russian .  i like long stories . " ) ,  his somber part seems designed only to elicit our sympathy .  besides paulie , the only character worth noting - other than 2 cute small parts played by cheech marin and gina rowlands - is the speech-impaired marie , played in a precious performance by cinematic newcomer , 5-year-old hallie kate eisenberg .  naturally enchanting , she gives the picture genuine heart .  the bad news is that her part is confined to the first half .  the best scenes have the bird dancing and strutting to show off his comedic skills .  when marie's family gets a cat , for example , the bird , who hasn't wanted to learn how to fly until then , takes an instant interest in soaring .  tricking the cat while insulting him at the same time , paulie calls him a stupid hairball .  their rapid physical antics add to the humor of the situation .  it's good quality sitcom material but performed by animals .  when one of the humans without much of a voice begins to sing , paulie cringes .   " i'm a bird , " he explains with his frequently subtle humor .   " i have a small brain , and it's about to explode . "  the movie contains rich doses of john debney's dreamy music .  with heavy use of a solo violin , he keeps reinforcing the film's heart-warming themes .  and when paulie finally takes off in flight , the orchestra comes up loud and strong with cymbals clashing .   " it's a long story , " says paulie .   " it's the only kind he knows , " reflects misha .  and the motion picture , which runs the standard length for a kids' movie , still feels too long .  the best parts are enthralling , but then there are all of those dead spots in-between .  paulie is a movie that never quite lives up to its promise but manages to charm nevertheless .  paulie runs 1 : 32 .  it is raged pg for a few mild profanities and would be fine for all ages .  my son , jeffrey , age 9 , gave the movie * * with his biggest complaint being that there wasn't enough action .  he thought paulie was funny , and the actress that played marie was quite good .  his friend sam , almost 9 , thought the movie was " awesome , excellent , " and gave it * * * * .  he thought paulie was good , but he didn't believe the way marie's speech impediment was acted .  
synopsis : sullen julie james , still haunted by nightmares of the killer ben willis from i know what you did last summer , perks up when her new best friend karla wilson wins a trip for four to the bahamas .  arriving at the start of the hurricane season , julie and karla run around in very tight clothing and realize they've walked into a trap set by the rainslickered slasher with a huge hook for a hand .  comments : i may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here , but i have never seen an episode of the fox tv series " party of five . "  i am only vaguely aware of the show's premise , and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials i half-paid attention to while watching the tube .   " party of five , " i do know however , seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre .  neve campbell , scream queen of the 90s and star of scream , scream 2 , and the craft , is a regular of the show .  so too is jennifer love hewitt .  lo and behold , following in the footsteps of campbell , hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own : the i know what you did last summer line .  though the original film , released last year , was watchable enough , this insipid sequel had me looking at the theater's glowing red exit sign longingly throughout .  jennifer love hewitt is a very good-looking young leading lady ; however , unlike neve campbell , hewitt struggles with acting .  she just isn't convincing in this film ( and she wasn't in the original either ) .  this puts many young males , including myself , in a paradoxical quandary : she's very attractive , but the annoying , spoiled , valley girl-type character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize , exploitatively , her figure .  add to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy , another rising teen tv star , and you get one frustrated male audience .  i've spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for a reason .  i still know what you did last summer , though cashing in on the success of the original , ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses .  nothing else here is original or interesting .  this movie , in fact , makes other recent so-so horror films like urban legend and john carpenter's vampires seem like stunning works of high art .  i still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches : an isolated location , a storm , parentless teenagers , false alarm nightmares , lots of blue-lighted darkness scenes , a garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him , knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere , etc . you get the picture .  the entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killer's hook .  they may as well have huge targets painted on them .  like scream and its numerous knockoffs , these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief .  unfortunately , i still know's characters aren't all that funny .  in particular , one character , a chain-weed-smoking guy , is obnoxiously annoying and certainly doesn't die soon enough .  the death scenes , by the way , are relatively violent for a theatrically released horror film .  several of them are uncomfortable to watch , and they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser : bloodline , a truly sadistic movie .  this , too , did not help the supposed humor i still know was shooting for .  and what is the deal with the slasher himself ?  i know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre , but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror .  come on , the guy looks like the gorton's fisherman , and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate .  though his lightning-lit appearances ellicited much-needed laughter in the theater , his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film , and that's * really * saying something .  so , all that's left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy .  both prance about in tightfitting , revealing outfits or in various states of undress , yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene .  hewitt , however , does do a post-shower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite .   .   . titillating .  this scene alone made this one-star turkey earn two stars under my rating system .  otherwise , hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves .  early in the film , for instance , brandy wins the trip to the bahamas .  she and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever .  i needed extra-strength tylenol after that part .  oh , and the film's conclusion , talk about repetitive !  people who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still know's ending at least 5 minutes before it happens .  boring !  i saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater .  admission is only one dollar on wednesdays , and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them .  it's usually a fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience , who don't seem to mind participating in a mass " mystery science theater 3000 " -type viewing .  i still know what you did last summer , however , produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience , underscoring how bad it * really * is .  if it weren't for the main actresses' revealing wardrobes , i'd have had a very , very hard time sitting through this lame sequel .  i can't imagine trying to watch it on video ( horror films seem 10 times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audience participation ) and wouldn't recommend it to people , unless they're horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy .  i read on a website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works .  what a depressing thought .  hewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act .  rated r , this film contains lots of violence , several gory scenes , and a couple nubile , horny teenagers--though the sex act itself is always thwarted .  i'd say this is unsuitable for kids , but teens wouldn't have a problem sitting through it , especially since they obviously compose the film's target audience .  
a documentary from the twin hughes brothers , allen and albert ( dead presidents , menace ii society ) , about street pimps , all of whom are african-american .  an offscreen interviewer questions them about their lives and profession .  it is mostly the pimps who do the talking for their ho's , and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be , is what you get .  i learned that the word " bitch " is their favorite word , as it seemed to crop up in every sentence they used .  it makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say , but if one has a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about , then some of what they rap about might seem amusing .  they seem to all want to be thought of as businessmen , in the business because it is the easiest way for them to make big money .  it's also a power trip , accomplished by manipulating the girls to work for them , mostly by humiliating them and keeping them in place .  this sleazy pic , soon became grating and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears .  these verbose pimps had a smart answer for everything and never knew when to shut their face .  the hughes brothers used as their pimp role models , the feather-hatted , fur-coated , diamond ring-wearing , gold chain wearing , flashy cadillac-cruising pimp of the late '70s blaxploitation movies--like the mack and willie dynamite .  also used as reference , was iceberg slim's best-seller pimp , the story of my life .  we meet pimps such as : fillmore slim , c-note , charm , k-red , gorgeous dre , bishop don magic juan , and rosebudd .  they readily discuss their business arrangements : including percentages , lifestyles , knockin ( stealing another pimp's ho ) , and the thrill they get from women giving them money .  these dudes needed no prompting to talk , as they just love to brag about about themselves .   " priests need nuns , '' yaps c-note , a san francisco pimp .   " doctors need nurses .  so ho's need pimps . ''  as he tries to persuasively make the same case all the other pimps in the film make ; that the girls need them to show them the ropes , how to make money , to be their security blankets , protectors , and counselors .  the race issue was brought up right from the film's onset , as a number of white interviewees , regular citizens , note that their impression of a pimp , is that he's the lowest form of human .  while , we are told , in the black community , the pimp is looked upon as a successful entrepenaur , riding around in fancy cars , flashing wads of money , dressed in a flamboyant style , where his snake-gaiter shoes might cost him a grand , and where he boasts hollywood style status in the community .  we also see that the black pimps have a number of white girls in their stable and we see how they treat them like dirt , as the film implies that this could be payback for the days of slavery , of master and slave relations .  the film was all about pimp style and their projected image , as they run a hard-sell riff about the virtues of their work .  there are different styles of pimping , but the film mentions them only as being " macks " and " players " or " real pimps " and " perpetrator pimps , " but no further clarity is attempted .  it is also failed to get the women's side to this story of abuse , primarily taking the pimp at his word .  the film could never get to the core of what makes the pimp think in such a perverted way as he does , as the filmmakers were taking for a ride by the pimps , who were looking only to pose in front of the camera and say their thing , hungry for their 15-minutes of fame .  the only laughs i got out of this bleak look at an american subculture , was hearing how a few pimps retired and what they are now up to .  danny brown became a blues singer so he could keep his pimp's wardrobe .  while a hollywood pimp called rosebudd , married his ho and turned square , working to support his wife and daughter as a telemarketer .  
when i originally saw the trailer for " analyze this " a few months ago , i must admit , i thought it looked kind of lame .  and then when the commercials started popping up a week or two ago , i thought it looked outright bad .  but then when " analyze this " finally opened a few days ago , an odd thing happened .  it got great reviews .  critics were proclaiming it " hilarious " and a " dead-on parody of mob movies " .  well , with praise like that , i figured , it must be good and so i headed off to the theater .  you know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts ?  well , turns out that expression is more valid than i ever gave it credit for .   " analyze this " is slow , unfunny , and badly acted .  don't get me wrong , i think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century , but he is just out of his league here .  i think the problem is he didn't quite know how to approach this material .  he plays his character , mob boss paull vitti , somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama .  if he had played the character straight , along the lines of leslie nielson in the " naked gun " series , he probably would have been a lot more successful .  as it is , though , he plays the character completely serious at some moments , and for laughs at others .  this doesn't work .  it creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold ; you always know it's him .  and the movie is badly paced , too .  it never takes off .  it just crawls from one scene to another without any forward momentum .  i think the blame for this should be placed on the script .  it's obvious the writer had a good idea for a movie , mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of a psychiatrist , but once this is established , the movie doesn't really go anywhere .  the formula of the film seems to be this : billy crystal says no to deniro , deniro forces him , and much wackiness ensues .  this formula of sorts is repeated several times throughout the movie .  i've said it before and i'll say it again : the only thing that matters to me in a comedy is whether or not it's funny .  if " analyze this " had been funny , the pacing and bad acting wouldn't have bothered me .  i would have been too busy laughing to notice .  but as it is , i only chuckled a few times .  the only really funny scene is a dead-on parody of " the godfather " .  sadly , though , i don't think anyone in the audience i saw it with realized it was a parody , because i was the only one laughing .  but my sense of humour , i have come to realize , is vastly different from the general population .  i loathed " there's something about mary " , yet loved " baseketball " .  now , if you want a movie that * i * think is funny , go out and see " office space " .  it's full of genuine laughs and won't leave you glancing at your watch every 10 minutes , as " analyze this " did .  
a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature , beams itself onto a russian science vessel .  well , this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent and original movie and simply becomes a predictable sci-fi thriller .  anyhow , this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the ? virus' known as man .  the original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated , and then a hapless crew on a tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it .  no more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies , the movie is that predictable .  the story is full of very shallow characters that don't do much other than subsist .  the captain of the tug , played by donald sutherland , makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age ( looks to be in his 60's ) .  to add to this we're shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields , and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks .  some of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on a tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific , in a typhoon no less .  none of the characters seem to work together at all ; they are always bickering and vying for some form of control .  this makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story , a story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable .  all the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects .  the waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in a tub and someone is simply creating waves .  it looks genuinely fake , granted trying to recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in a style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish .  also on the topic of flaws , the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly , why ?  if this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics , should it not be able to create them move faster ?  regardless , the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the film rather than add to it .  as to the actual casting for the movie , finally there is nothing to complain about .  the actors were superb , but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles .  having the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe .  watching these actors act this story out made it bearable , if barely .  the one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening .  so if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything grand and are only going to kill some time and watch a mediocre sci-fi thriller then you won't be too disappointed .  as the movie is but the latest in a genre that was originally created by aliens , it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect .  this movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv .  
a suave , cool , collected , rich , uptight bad guy = cliche .  a clumsy criminal oaf to add to the laughs = cliche .  a bad guy who owns a wild animal = cliche .  a crooked , chauvinistic law enforcer type = cliche .  at an intense moment , our main character tries to get away , but the car has trouble starting = cliche .  complaining about cliches = cliche .  ok , ok .  so we always hear about cliches .  but if there was ever to be a prime example , the real mccoy is it !  not one uttered word , not one frame of film , not one character in this whole movie isn't a cut and paste example of everything we've ever seen .  they might as well use this as a training film : " how to make a bank robbery film in the 90's " .  karen mccoy ( kim basinger ) is a bank robber who just got out on parole after a six-year stay at the state prison .  she wants to make things right and go straight , especially with the fact that she has a six-year old son out there who doesn't even know she's alive .  aware of mccoy's bank robbing expertise , sniveling bad guy jack schmidt ( terence stamp ) uses the same six-year old to coerce mccoy into returning to her past .  he wants mccoy to pull off an elaborate heist of 18+ million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying to rob six years earlier , which , by the way , is somehow due to schmidt .  and if she refuses ?  who knows what he'll do to the kid .   ( cue sinister laughter )  this movie is so pathetically pitiful that it's hard to know where to begin .  the aforementioned cliches are brutally abundant .  i can't stress enough how every single element , whether it be a character , the dialogue , a plot " twist " , etc . , is so damn generic that you'll wonder if * anyone * is working behind the scenes , let alone in front of the camera .  basinger is absolutely vacant .  and where do they get off trying to make us emotionally attached to her ?  here's someone that spent their time robbing banks , and now as she heads onto the street , we're supposed to feel sorry for her .  as she confronts her son , who doesn't even know who she is , are we supposed to break into tears ? ?  especially when neither basinger nor zach english , who plays the kid , has any depth or emotional-radiance whatsoever .  i suppose i should mention val kilmer .  yeah , that's right - he's in it !  quite sadly too , seeing as how i can discuss everything about the movie and never mention his name .  and he got second billing !  to be fair , i will admit that kilmer had potential in his role as the bumbling criminal wannabe j . t .  barker .  unfortunately the script doesn't allow much room for improvement , and when his character is used like bookends ( he never shows up in the middle of the film ! ) ,  we have no time to appreciate what he might have brought to this project .  the real mccoy just can't keep it's head above water , and soon , * very * soon , sinks into a cliched mess of movie .  the actors are like dummies being moved about by an unenthusiastic puppeteer , and the dialogue , particularly schmidt's trite dialogue , falls like the niagra .  this is definitely one to avoid , folks .  the real mccoy is anything but !  
inspired by the 1958 film house on haunted hill starring vincent price .  directed by william malone .  starring geoffrey rush , famke janssen , and chris kattan .  rated r ( contains violence , profanity , and brief nudity ) .  synopsis : eccentric millionaire price offers $1 , 000 , 000 to each of his guests who appear at a gathering at a former sanitarium .  the only catch is that they have to survive the night at the establishment , an establishment haunted by its former staff and patients .  comments : house on haunted hill is based upon the original 1958 film of the same title directed by william castle and starring vincent price .  in an obvious homage , the millionaire's name is price and he sports a thin mustache like price used to have .  this is a pretty bad horror film , yet bad horror films sometimes are very entertaining , and house on haunted hill is just such a film .  it is , surprisingly , better than another recent haunted house remake , the haunting , a film which owes its basis to the classic horror novel by shirley jackson .  the haunting had literary pretensions and fell flat on it face .  house on haunted hill owes its lineage to a b-movie 40 years old and makes no illusion that it's a crappy horror movie .  thus , somehow , it proves slightly more successful .  i can't think of another recent film which has had such an eclectic cast .  it is this cast which lifts this ho-hum thriller into a borderline entertaining exercise in camp horror .  price , the main character , is played by geoffrey rush , the academy-award winning actor of shine .  rush seems to be making a downward spiral in the movie industry , a spiral reminiscent of ben ( ghandi , schindler's list ) kingsley's ridiculous appearance in the camp sci-fi classic species .  i don't know why , but sometimes it's entertaining to see " quality " actors in bad movies .  more surprises ?  rising star taye diggs plays a stereotypical african american sports figure ( rather lamely too ) , and singer lisa loeb ( ! )  appears as a tv news reporter .  the highlight of the cast , however , has to be saturday night live member chris kattan .  kattan's comic sense provides several good humorous moments as he plays the hysterical proprietor of the former sanitarium .  while the first half of the film leaves the audience guessing as to what's exactly going on , the second half dissolves into standard ghost story stuff and loses some of its suspense .  a disappointingly cheesy ending really mars this movie too .  house on haunted hill , i suspect , has just about left the second-run theaters .  it's worth catching on cable next year , if you get a chance .  if you have a choice , pick this movie over the haunting , it's the better of two evils , you could say .  though , more appropriately perhaps , it'd be better to say that it's the better of two turkeys .  
even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material , as this subpar submarine comedy proves .  down periscope stars kelsey " frasier " grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt officer's ( james coburn ) plan to get him out of the navy .  like any lame emsemble comedy , the officer assigns him to a group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out , the fat guy who eats all the time , the beautiful woman who doesn't belong there ( lauren holly ) , the second-in-command who does everything by the book ( rob schneider ) , the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out ( harry dean stanton ) and so on .  then comes the transparent plotline .  first grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him , and that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard .  after the ship is fixed up come the early drills , where everyone seems completely inept , like the electrician who can't connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone .  finally , and this covers the final hour of the movie , grammer has to lead his men ( and holly ) to overcome the other ships in a wargames exercise .  and he has to be a clever rebel to do it , in scenes that stretch all levels of believability .  first they're singing " louie louie " like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off , then thirty minutes later , they're making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off .  the whole while , evil captain coburn is overacting underwater , cursing grammer ( as most people watching the movie probably are too ) .  it's all predictable without any original humor to redeem it .  the jokes are right out of " mchale's navy " and other cut-rate sitcoms of the past .  there's one scene where schneider looks through the ship's pantry in disgust , holds one food can up and announces , " this expired in 1966 ! "  i yelled back at the screen , " so did these jokes . "  i watched this movie with the whole family and everyone hated it .  my mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway through and , around the start of the second hour , i started writing my will .  the blame can't really be placed on the stars , though .  kelsey grammer is good in this , he just doesn't have anything to work with .  his character is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had " welcome aboard " tatooed on his penis .  grammer probably did something even worse -- got really drunk and agreed to appear in a movie he knew nothing about .  same for holley ( save the penis part ) , who is likeable in down periscope just because she's so gorgeous .  as for schneider ( whose character is downright annoying ) , there was nowhere to go but up after surf ninjas , although he's still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the " snl " ship .  my theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as a formula comedy ( " okay , it's police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber . " ) and after everyone was signed on turned into a disaster .  judging from the video box , most other movie critics agree with me .  the only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up came from the prevue channel's jim ferguson .  i guess even jeff craig from " 60 second preview " ( who said tank girl " kicks butt ! "  without ever seeing it ) didn't like this .  
as bad as " mimic " was , it definitly scared me .   " mimic " continued the frightening hollywood trend of taking a foreign director who shows a lot of creative ingenuity and style , and completely flushing it when he comes to america to make a movie .  director guillermo del toro was recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning and inventive horror film " cronos . "  that movie worked because it took an unconventional story , unique characters and well written plot and dialogue to create a truly scary movie .  in " mimic " , del toro doesn't bother to give us anything original .  the plot is a stupid combination of " aliens " meets " species " meets " jurassic park . "  the characters have been recycled from a few hundred other movies .  there's nothing new in " mimic " .  it's just a bunch of old tricks that rarely work .  at the end of the movie , you're stuck wanting your money back .  maybe the worst thing about the movie is that del toro followed another annoying trend of recent movies : he forgot to turn the lights on .  i don't understand why suspense movies lately have to follow the " seven " trend and be set in dark , dank areas .  watching " mimic " i was tempted several times to yell at the screen " turn the lights on !  the switch is to your right !  use common sense !  just do it !  you'll be able to see the monster in the corner ! "  there's a scene where mira sorvino is standing in subway station while the lights are flickering on and off .  it looked like the light operator was having a seizure , and sorvino didn't even notice - she just stood there looking like she was having deep thoughts .   " hmmm . . . .  i think bean soup would be good for dinner tonight . "   " mimic " has a lot of incidental shock tactics ( boo !  just kidding ! ) and follows them up with the real scare , but nothing in this movie scares you .  the audience in the theater never jumped during suspenseful moments ; i think they were bored , too .  i shouldn't blame del toro .  he isn't the first successful foreign director to come to hollywood and make a bad movie .  hong kong director john woo made two of the best action films of all time , " the killer " and " hard boiled " then came to america to make the stupid " broken arrow . "  french directors luc besson ( " la femme nikita " ) and george sluizer ( " the vanishing " ) followed woo's lead and made dumbed down versions of those movies .  robert rodriguez , who directed the terrific low budget " el mariachi " came to hollywood and directed the horrible , high-budget " desperado . "  i don't know why a foreign director who shows such talent in his country can't make a good american movie .  woo finally broke through and made " face/off " , but it still isn't up to par with his earlier films .  i get the feeling a hollywood producer sits in his office , chews on a big smelly cigar and says to the director , " welcome to america !  i bet you must be tired after being on that boat for so long .  do you speak english ?  now , i know you think you've made good movies in the past , but now you're in america , so things are a little different here .  just remember what the american audience always wants , and you'll be fine .  they want to see at least one big breasted woman , characters that they've seen a thousand times before ( because change scares americans ) , and you always need a cheesy feel-good ending to wrap things up .  if you don't make that kind of movie , you'll be shining my shoes in no time .

all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos , please raise your hands .  thank you for identifying yourselves ; now would you all please go away .  your influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade , and it shows no sign of abating any time soon .  it isn't just the strobe light quality of your twenty-cuts-per-minute editing , or the numbing over-use of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised " featuring the music of . . . " no , it is a kind of cynicism you have perfected , banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of a story if you include enough bells and whistles .  welcome to the club , scott kalvert .  your adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and one-dimensional , serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole .  dicaprio stars as jim carroll , the new york poet/songwriter/ performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based .  as the film opens , jim is a budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey ( mark wahlberg ) , pedro ( james madio ) and neutron ( patrick mcgaw ) .  one night , jim graduates from inhalants to cocaine , and shortly thereafter to heroin .  jim's addiction to the drug starts him on a downhill spiral , as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach ( bruno kirby ) , kicked out of his home by his mother ( lorraine bracco ) , and drops out of school .  along with mickey and pedro , jim becomes a victim of the street , living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower .  the basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years , but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner .  screenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carroll's posse , resulting in a jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic , but now with equally unsympathetic friends .  as a film , the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale , a 100 minute long " just say no " public service announcement , but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie .  jim is sort of a jerk even before he becomes a junkie , but i suppose that his pseudo-sensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out .  perhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those " good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd " that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be ; i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd .  without a character who changes in any appreciable way , the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strung-out cohorts , all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack .  director scott kalvert doesn't have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work , so he substitutes silly slow-motion photography , self-consciously funky camera angles and choppy editing .  on only one occasion , when a steady pan around a room where jim is trying to detox makes it appear that the walls are closing in , are any of the gimmicks effective .  mostly , they just draw attention to how hollow the story is .  they also don't allow leonardo dicaprio's performance to be as strong as it could have been .  for every impressive moment , like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money , there is a scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics .  dicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors , particularly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an ex-junkie who tries to help jim straighten out , but kalvert won't let character interaction define this story .  he wants to turn dicaprio into a rock star , shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting .  at isolate moments , the basketball diaries is a fine showcase for dicaprio's talents .  far more frequently , it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what a long form velvet underground video might have looked like .  
movies about teenagers and teenage culture rarely prove to be either interesting , entertaining or convincing , because of one fundamental reason : movies are made by adults and not teenagers .  occasionally , however , films like say anything , dazed and confused and the breakfast club will break the mold and offer genuine insight into the lives of those bizarre creatures which surround us called " teenagers . "  can't hardly wait , however , does not .  instead , the writing/directing team of harry elfont and deborah kaplan manages to take every clich ? found in the teenage genre , strip it completely of perception , intelligence and wit - and turn it into one of the most nauseating cinematic experiences i have ever been subjected to .  can't hardly wait follows a group of characters as they attend a house party on the night of their high school graduation .  the main characters are such perfected stereotypes that no analysis needs to be provided to perfectly understand them : there's the average male protagonist preston ( ethan embry ) , prom queen and cheerleader amanda ( jennifer love-hewitt ) , football star mike ( peter facinelli ) , white rapper wannabe kenny ( seth green ) , computer geek william ( charlie korsmo ) , and brainy outsider denise ( lauren ambrose ) .  i couldn't stand any of those characters .  whether it was william getting drunk and signing along to heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming " yo , i gotta have sex tonight ! " ,  all i could think of was how elfont and kaplan possibly managed to con columbia pictures out of ten million dollars to fund their film .  apparently , can't hardly wait is supposed to be a comedy , but it tends to fail in this respect because of the fact that it's not funny .  in all honesty , elfont and kaplan should be forced by their employers to attend remedial classes in humour .  and when i say " forced " , i mean it .  they should be strapped down to a chair and have their eyes wedged open in a similar fashion to alex in a clockwork orange .  this is how desperately they need to be educated about the concept of humour .  for instance , can't hardly wait features a foreign exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statements such as " i am a sex machine . "  for some reason , elfont and kaplan believe that if this character repeats it enough , eventually it will be funny .  if only elfont and kaplan could recognise the irony that they actually got paid for making this junk - now that's funny .  
one of the 90s' most unwelcome thriller trends returns from the grave : it's the " ___ from hell " movie !  starting in the early nineties , we were subjected to nearly every conceivable combination of relationships-from-hell !  there were boyfriends from hell , friendly neighborhood cops from hell , nannies from hell , and even secretaries from hell .  but hush has found an old standby that somehow was forgotten in the rush : the mother-in-law from hell ! ! ! ! !  the mother-in-law in question is martha , played by jessica lange .  she has been single-handedly running the family horse farm , kilronan .  her son , jackson ( johnathon schaech ) and his girlfriend , helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , live in new york , and have no intention to move back down south to the rural kilronan .  but those intentions are about to change .  you see , martha lives by manipulation .  she has used it in years past to breed many championship horses .  now , she believes she can use it to breed herself a grandson .  though at first , helen finds martha charming , soon she is caught in the domineering martha's web of deception .  it's hard to understand why nobody ever wises up to martha' schemes .  as written , most of the characters in the film must be very slow witted .  but then , the film even treats the audience like idiots .  it tries to get away with things ( like leaving a critical piece of evidence in a rather unlikely place ) without even batting an eye .  then again an audience which accepts characters as shallow as these isn't one that's likely to question details .  jessica lange's martha is the only semi-developed character in the film , and she applies her talents to redeem it as much as she can .  a character that could have been simply awful is merely groan-worthy .  gwyneth paltrow doesn't have much to build upon , as helen's only character trait seems to be " daughter-in-law " .  still , she fares better than johnathon schaech , whose character is so nonexistent , he's inexplicably missing for much of the film .  still , there have been much worse " ____ from hell " films .  even with its paper-thin characters and ludicrous setups , hush manages to create a few thrills in a color-by-numbers fashion .  you know what's coming , but occasionally the film will deliver a shock or two .  the old formulas are around for a reason , but that doesn't mean they taste fresh .  
i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year , when matthew perry had just signed on .  i'm big fan of perry's subtle sense of humor , and in addition , i think chris farley's on-edge , extreme acting was a riot .  so naturally , when the trailer for " almost heroes " hit theaters , i almost jumped up and down .  a soda in hand , the lights dimming , i was ready to be blown away by farley's final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perry's big breakthrough .  i was ready to be just amazed ; for this to be among farley's best , in spite of david spade's absence .  i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran .  sadly , none of this came to pass .  the humor is spotty at best , with good moments and laughable one-liners few and far between .  perry and farley have no chemistry ; the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade , for it's his type of humor , and not at all what perry is associated with .  and the movie tries to be smart , a subject best left alone when it's a farley flick .  the movie is a major dissapointment , with only a few scenes worth a first look , let alone a second .  perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie , and not surprisingly ; the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley .  and farley's classic humor is widespread , too .  almost heroes almost works , but misses the wagon-train by quite a longshot .  guys , let's leave the exploring to lewis and clark , huh ?  stick to " tommy boy " , and we'll all be " friends " .  
starring arnold schwarzenegger ; danny devito ; emma thompson & frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is a disappointment , and a big one at that .  junior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito with director ivan reitman .  these are the same men that brought us the very funny twins .  so foolish me , i was hoping for something that would at least come close to the level of quality of twins .  so much for hopes .  schwarzenegger and devito play two scientists ( doctors hesse and arbogast ) who are working on a new drug that will reduce the possibility of miscarriage in pregnancy .  unfortunately , due to circumstances beyond their control , they are denied permission to test this new drug on humans , and subsequently lose their funding .  still believing that their drug will work , they decide to test it anyway , on hesse .  so , dr . hesse ( schwarzenegger ) artificially inseminates himself and begins taking the drug .  their theory is that if the drug can prevent a man from miscarrying , surely it will work on a woman .  does the thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous to you ?  well , it must have to the producers of junior .  admittedly , schwarzenegger has the comedic talent to pull it off .  perhaps if it had been done differently it might have actually been funny .  but it wasn't , schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best .  the sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come with pregnancy , and the accompanying emotional swings , is not funny .  schwarzenegger comes very close to embarrassing himself with these antics .  i kept thinking to myself , with the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been making an action picture .  better yet , with schwarzenegger , devito and reitman all in the same place at the same time , why didn't they make a sequel to twins ?  anything would have been better than this mess .  danny devito is wasted in this movie .  his part could have been played by any joker they pulled in off the street .   ( after seeing the movie , if i was devito , i probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street . )  emma thompson is wasted here as well .  while thompson is best known for her jane austin adaptations , she is also a fine comedian .  too bad she didn't get to use any of that talent here .  am i being too hard on this film ?  i don't think so .  schwarzenegger and devito are two of my favorite actors in film today , and ivan reitman is one of the more talented directors in hollywood .  with a supporting cast of emma thompson and frank langella , the filmmakers really have to be trying hard to make a bad film .  they certainly managed here .  maybe it was well intentioned , but unfortunately this is a movie that never should have been made .  if you are tempted to see this film , do yourself a favor and go rent twins , a film that truly takes advantage of arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito's comedic talents .  
when you've run out of old tv shows to turn into movies , i guess you try video games .  why did i go to see mortal kombat : annihilation ?  the quest to seek an answer to this query may prove a better movie that the one i just saw .  this film was a bunch of fighting , yelling , special effects , and bad acting set to an oppressive techno music soundtrack .  the plot is fairly simple : a portal has opened between our world and the " outworld " , allowing evil forces commanded by shao kahn ( brian thompson ) to wreak havoc and attempt to destroy humanity .  the good guys , led by sorcerer rayden ( james remar ) and human mortal liu kang ( robin shou ) , must take the fight to outworld , where the fate of both worlds will be determined .  here's the catch : they must reunite princess katana ( talia soto ) , who's on the good side , with her resurrected mother queen sindel ( musetta vander ) , who's on the bad side , for their love for each other will close the portal and ensure humanity's safety for another generation .  how this is supposed to work , i still have no idea , but i liked katana's line , " i knew love would keep us together , " since that captain and tennille song ran through my head and i got a good laugh .  there are some seriously stupid things in this movie .  take , for example , a transportation system which utilizes the " inner winds " , generated by earth's magma flows .  you get in this metal ball which transports you through underground tunnels really fast .  how fast ?  as katana says , " you will be moving so fast , it will be as if you are not moving at all . "  what ?  later , sonya blade ( sandra hess ) goes to find jax ( lynn " red " williams , otherwise known as " saber " on tv's american gladiators ) at a medical research facility on the island of oahu .  how do we know this is where she went ?  there's a sign on the facility's perimeter fence that reads : medical research facility - oahu , hawaii .  remember , this is not a caption , but an actual sign .  i guess the location is on there for all those medical researchers who keep forgetting where they are .  there's a lot of major flipping action , too .  the first encounter between good and evil shows kahn and rayden swiftly arching though the air toward one another .  do they land and immediately get into the fighting ?  does one of them land first and catch the other off guard ?  do they collide in mid-air ?  no , apparently they flip toward each other so they can talk without having to yell from far away .  why did they need those metal balls to travel ?  everyone could have just flipped from point a to point b .  i have to admit , the fight scenes are pretty good , although you can tell they are heavily enhanced by digital effects and fly wires , allowing the characters to surpass the limits of the human body and the laws of physics .  the movie's thrills are derived from these scenes and most of the audience responses are on the visceral level when someone gets trashed really badly .   " ouch " was the most common expletive heard when i screened this one .  you could tell that the filmmakers knew in advance that fights , not plot , would be the main draw , since dialog is apparently in the film just to get from one fight to the next .  it seems that's all there is in this movie .  maybe it is .  as i had mentioned , the acting is bad .  there's not one solid performance in the film , although williams as jax was pretty funny .  after a fight between sonya and one of the bad guys degenerates into female mud wrestling , jax says , " you look good in mud .  no , really , you do . "  remar plays rayden with an inconsistency which makes it hard to take his character seriously , and shou is relatively emotionless as liu kang .  brian thompson , who has played good guys , bad guys , and even an alien on tv's the x-files , but always some muscle-bound behemoth , is your average evil demi-god , but it's more the script's fault than his own that he doesn't have anything original to say .  the one really impressive thing about this movie is that there is not one swear word in the whole hour and a half .  another thing which should be noted is that for all its punching and kicking , blood only appears in one scene .  all in all , mortal kombat : annihilation is loud , violent , shallow , and marketed toward kids .  hey , just like the video game !  
note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  to assess alex cox's film the winner as a loser would be so indolent .  it would be derisive .  it would be glib .  it would be dismissive .  it would be entirely accurate .  rarely have i seen a film as excruciatingly annoying as the winner , a would-be comedy which quickly proves to be tedious , unfunny , and unengaging .  the film attempts to be fresh and quirky , utilising a myriad of colourful characters to weave its absurd tale , but appears to overlook the fact that nobody in the film is remotely interesting and that all of the characters are essentially preposterous .  the film is set in las vegas , and the focus in the winner is on philip ( vincent d'onofrio ) , an aloof , naive young man blessed with the odd gift of luck ; he virtually cannot lose at the tables .  despite this prodigious talent , philip is perpetually mournful and quite indifferent about his gambling fortunes , neither taking joy in his winnings nor having the foresight to mask his abilities .  consequently , he becomes an easy target for those who would ride upon his coattails and take advantage of his talent .  louise ( rebecca demornay ) , a sultry lounge singer , insinuates herself into philip's life for the purpose of swindling him , while philip's estranged brother ( and , conveniently , louise's ex-beau ) johnny ( michael madsen ) arrives on the scene .   ( to add some colour , johnny also happens to be toting their father's corpse , sans one hand . )  meanwhile , philip is also befriended by a trio of low-rent , opportunists ( frank whaley , billy bob thornton , and richard edson ) , who have every intention of taking advantage of their new buddy's gift with the dice .  serenely overlooking the chaos from behind the scenes is the casino owner ( delroy lindo ) ; it is probably not giving away much to reveal that his role in the winner is essentially that alluded to at the end of the flashy sequence in martin scorsese's casino which details the organization hierarchy of a casino's operations - he * is * the eye in the sky .  it could be maddening to endure a film whose central protagonist is so oblivious of the ongoing blatant manipulation , but fortunately this is not the case in the winner , if only because our sadsack hero is such a sap ; not even remotely sympathetic or compelling , it becomes impossible to root for philip or even care about his fate , and the would-be swindlers of philip's fortunes are all drawn out as such ludicrous , transparent buffoons with entirely unimaginative and uninteresting schemes that one watches the winner with a complete sense of disinterest .  it is a shame , as the winner features a talented cast - mr . d'onofrio is an underrated and gifted actor with a huge range ; mr . lindo has a remarkable screen presence which infiltrates every film in which he appears ; mr . madsen , ms . demornay , and mr . whaley have all done good work in the past .  none of the actors in the winner are in top form here , and this film won't likely be a prized addition to their respective resumes .  director alex cox does what he can with wendy riss' screenplay , and it is to his credit that this film at no point feels like an adaptation of a stage play ; i was startled to learn that the winner was in fact based upon one .  while tedious , the film is well-paced and does not meander , but it would be near-impossible task for mr . cox ( or , for that matter , virtually any other director that comes to mind ) to overcome the film's widespread shortcomings in plot and characterization .  to his credit , my understanding is that he has chosen to distance himself from the project in acknowledgement of its deficiencies .  i caught the winner at its world premiere at the toronto international film festival in september 1996 , and in fairness it is entirely possible that the film has been extensively revamped since then due to the lacklustre audience reaction generated - there were more walkouts on this film than any of the others i screened .  to be honest , though , i couldn't begin to isolate what could be done to this film to improve it - i assume that throwing the whole thing out and starting over is out of the question .  the winner has apparently played on cable television in the united states and is beginning a limited theatrical release at the time of this writing .  the film has a nice upbeat score by pray for rain , but i am honestly not being facetious when i state that the thing i treasured most about my screening of the winner was the bag of popcorn upon which i was munching .  
while i am not fond of any writer's use of cheap , easy puns , i am not completely above using them myself when the situation merits it ( witness my review of _pecker_ from a couple of issues ago ) .  so here goes : the juvenile , college-set black comedy _dead_man_on_campus_ is dead on arrival .  strait-laced med student josh ( tom everett scott , who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout ) 's blemish-free academic record breaks out into fs , thanks to the influence of his ever-partying roommate , cooper ( mark-paul gosselaar ) , who introduces josh to the sex- and booze-filled nights that come with university life .  with the threat of losing an academic scholarship ( josh ) and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming ( cooper ) , what are two good-hearted slackers to do ?  easy--look for a loophole , which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school charter that states that if a student's ( or students' ) roommate commits suicide , the surviving student ( s ) shall receive straight as .  so instead of studying , josh and cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there , move him into their dorm room , and drive him to suicide before the semester ends .  director alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike white ( working from a story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder ) take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and cooper's diabolical plot .  until then , the usual boring cliches of college life ( booze , sex , more booze ) fill the time , which is made to feel longer by _saved_by_the_bell_ alumnus gosselaar's sitcom-bred mugging .  that said , once cohn and company do build some comic momentum , they mishandle it .  the introduction of the manic , psychotic cliff ( lochlyn munro ) , a potential roommate for josh and cooper , brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting candidates : paranoid nerd buckley ( randy pearlstein ) and british death rocker matt ( corey page ) .  one wishes that cliff would reappear , but , as they say , be careful what you wish for .  not surprisingly , he does resurface , and it then becomes clear that this is a character that is best taken in a small dose ; almost immediately , his extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty .  the same can be said about all of _dead_man_on_campus_ .  whatever morbid appeal the far-fetched premise has quickly evaporates , and the self-absorbed characters , especially cooper , pretty much grate from the get-go .  _dead_man_ doesn't grow tiresome ; it already _is_ once the clever opening titles are through .  as it slogs along to a cheesy , happy-for-all-parties conclusion , _dead_man_ lives up to its title and then some--not only does the movie grow even more tired and die , it still insists on going on . . .  like a zombie .  
in " twilight , " a ex-alcoholic , ex-cop , ex-husband , ex-private-eye , harry ross ( paul newman ) , works for a pair of aging hollywood actors , catherine ( susan sarandon ) and jack ames ( gene hackman ) .  jack is being blackmailed , and he asks harry to deliver the payoff .  instead of the blackmailers , harry finds a dying ex-cop ( m .  emmet walsh ) .  as more bodies begin to pile up , harry realizes that he will have to solve the disappearance of catherine's first husband twenty years earlier to find out who's willing to kill to keep that secret buried .  newman . sarandon .  hackman .  with an a-list cast of oscar laureates like that , " twilight " would seem very promising .  however , the script is tired and predictable .  it would serve well as a tv-movie-of-the-week , possibly with some 1970's detective hero reprising his role .  the appeal of the project for its stars and its director , robert benton , is nostalgia .   " twilight " wants very much to be a 1940's film noir with alan ladd or dick powell .  all of the standard tropes are here : a hard-boiled p . i .  among the rich and beautiful whose glamour hides sinister secrets , a femme fatale who tempts and confounds the hero , shadowy figures shooting from doorways , dead bodies confronting the hero at every turn , cops dogging his path and interfering with his investigation .  the script offers little originality , and co-authors benton and richard russo seem unaware that what was original in 1948 is a clich ? in 1998 .  elmer bernstein's score is hauntingly melodic and could have been drawn note-for-note from a vintage noir .  the lead actors try hard-none of the three has every made less than a full effort , even when burdened with a bad script .  they try to invest every line and gesture with meaning , and they create a convincing sense of the relationships between the main characters .  harry is fond of jack but is in love with catherine .  jack is dying of cancer and is jealous of harry's love for catherine .  catherine teases harry and enjoys his attention , but her real feelings are hidden beneath a carefully-maintained veneer .   " twilight " wants to be character-driven like " nobody's fool " ( also directed by benton , also starring newman , based on a novel by russo ) was , but the tired script gives the actors too little to work with .   " twilight " also squanders a fine supporting cast : stockard channing ( harry's friend on the police force ) , reese witherspoon ( jack & catherine's bratty kid ) , giancarlo esposito ( the humorous sidekick ) , john spencer ( harry's nemesis on the force ) , liev schreiber and margo martindale ( the blackmailers ) , and james garner ( a cop who bailed movie stars out of trouble ) .  
note to screenwriters and self : when you hit the big time , and the studios come knocking for those scripts that are sitting in your bottom drawer , tell ? em all to hit the road .  gilligan wrote the arbitrarily-titled home fries ten years ago ; it was shelved until he found success as one of " the took a second look at gilligan's " comedy " - they read it again wearing rose-tinted glasses .  drew stars as sally , a dim ( but sweet ) , pregnant waitress at a small town burger joint located somewhere in the southern united states .  the father of her child is dead , the victim of a severe heart attack brought on by sadistic torture from his two stepsons - these flyboys scared him with their low-flying helicopter .  dorian ( wilson ) and angus ( busey ) were getting even for his philandering ways on behalf of their anguished mother ( o'hara ) .  trouble is , sally picked up some interference on her drive-thru headset , and angus worries she may have heard conversations that took place in the helicopter prior to the accidental killing .  so dorian goes undercover as a burger-flipper ; before you can say " with cheese " he falls for the mother-to-be .  too bad mom and angus have homicidal plans for sally .  does this sound like a movie you want to see ?  without a doubt , the best thing about home fries is barrymore ; at the risk of sounding sexist , she's never looked better than here , as a curly redhead with twinkling eyes .  she is winning in a role that requires her to do absolutely nothing except look apple-cheek cute and gawk at wilson , her real-life boyfriend .  but the plot and the situations are so off-putting that nothing could save it .  this movie desperately wants to get mentioned in the same breath as the coen brothers , but home fries' brand of laboured hipness would be foreign to geniuses like ethan and joel .  it's raising arizona without babies , without charm , without laughs , without human characters , and without intelligence ; worst of all , it's creepy .  what's funny about threatening to gun down a pregnant woman with a machine gun ?   ( unless the woman in question is a spice girl . )  take out the helicopters , the quasi-incestuous relationship between the mother and her sons ( it is absolutely illogical , within the movie's framework , that dorian still lives with his mother and brother ) , and the scenes of murder ( attempted and otherwise ) , and what are you left with ?  the story of a single woman with child who works at a fast food joint ( but dreams of becoming a country singer ) .  that could turn out to be the most boring movie ever made , but it'd be better than home fries .  
gun wielding arnold schwarzenegger has a change of heart by the film's end and becomes a believer in god instead of a skeptic , going through an amazing transformation by having a christian epiphany in the final scene as he becomes someone who can now beat the devil by his faith alone . . . this is after two hours of throwing people out windows and shooting more people than your average serial killer .  nobody can save this bomb from it's own stupidity and arrogance in filmmaking and arrogance in believing that this is a positive religious-type of film .  it's just a pile of dreck . . . an  ill-conceived exploitive project , a pyrotechnical film .   " end of days " aims to be an apocalyptic thriller .  it features an idiotic script , a hack director , and a one-dimensional star who is past his prime . . . which  makes this film dumber than dumb , plus it's not funny , not campy , or is it in the least bit entertaining .  it's just dreary and unwatchable . . . a  big-budget slasher film .  arnold plays an alcoholic security guard who finds his new mission in life is to stop satan ( occupying gabriel byrne's body and possessing a wall st . bank account ) from destroying the world .  the film opens in vatican city , roma 1979 -- where the pope is alerted by a young visionary priest tomaso , looking out at the night sky and seeing a comet whiz by , who proclaims after looking at his scrolls -- that's the sign for the 'eye of god , ' which reveals that a child has been born who is being prepared to give birth to satan's baby ( the anti-christ ) in the hour before the new century begins , when satan will fuck her and open up the gates to hell on earth .  tomaso has some twenty years to find this woman and save her and the world from doom .  but some in the pope's circle want to kill her if found , even though the pope insists on having faith and letting her live , as he lectures them : " even in the world's darkest days -- doing evil doesn't stop evil , but brings on more evil . "  we saw the girl being born in nyc in 1979 , which seems to be the 'logical' place to look for satan according to the astrology charts of the visionaries .  the chosen woman is christine york ( robin ) .  it is now a few days before the new year celebration for 2000 and arnold and his wise-cracking security guard partner kevin pollack are hired to guard a wall street turd , and when he is fired upon by a renograde priest , thomas aquinas , arnold saves him and through a ridiculous chase captures the tongue less priest who fired the shot .  he , nevertheless , can speak and tells arnold an 'end of days' is coming as prophesized in revelations .  but satan gets to him in his hospital room and nails him to the ceiling while scribbling latin warnings of 'the end of the world' on his body .  it is now up to arnold to save the world and find the chosen woman .  he quickly finds christine and does everything to protect her from all the evil forces around her , as the film includes ludicrous helicopter rescues , people jumping out of windows , satan taking a piss and dropping a match to kill arnold's partner as the piss explodes like gasoline , satan being fired at . . . resulting in his sometimes experiencing pain and sometimes nothing , as if the director forgot which way he wants to have it .  there is nothing spared in nyc from fire bombs -- including the subway , churches , and luxury buildings .  the only trouble with all these high-budget action sequences , was that it lacked purpose and even entertainment value .  the story was so terrible and inaccurate , that it did not have an iota of value or credibility .  mercifully the movie drags to a final confrontation in times square , trying unsuccessfully to build tension to the countdown toward the year 2000 .  why is the end of 1999 considered to be the devil's number " 666 , '' well !   . . .  satan's numeral is actually " 999 , '' which is upside down of " 666 . ''  accordingly , you just put a " 1'' in front of it-- and bingo -- you get " 1999 . ''  with logic like that , this film might even think it pulled the wool over the viewer's eyes and got away with such a febrile explanation of the occult .  this film should become a classic used by film schools in how not to make a horror film .  i highly recommend seeing it for that purpose .  
surrounded by hype , high hopes , and the promise of an over-the-top performance by clueless's brittany murphy , don't say a word looked full of promise .  hell , when i hear that " i'll never tell " whisper on the tv commercial , goose bumps run up my spine .  alas , word is filled with little but disappointment , a kooky mix of girl , interrupted and ransom , with michael douglas and company collecting a paycheck to plod through a vapid and dull kidnapping thriller .  douglas stars as nathan conrad , renowned new york psychologist , devoted father of jessie conrad ( skye mccole bartusiak ) , and loving husband to aggie conrad ( famke janssen ) .  after a gang of jewel thieves , headed by sean bean's koster , kidnaps his daughter , nathan is forced to extract from his new patient , the catatonic and violent elisabeth burrows ( murphy ) , the location of some hidden bank job booty that her father hid from the koster gang a decade ago .  but with hard-nosed detective sandra cassidy ( jennifer esposito , doing her best j . lo impression ) tracking down koster and his gang of hoodlums , the stakes are raised as nathan races against the clock to crack the mystery of elisabeth's head in order to get the goods inside .  the catch - nathan only has until five o'clock to solve the puzzle !  whoa , the suspense is almost too much .  don't say a word loses the audience inside of 15 minutes .  murphy looks and acts like linda blair from the exorcist during the first part of the movie , then turns around and reprises like her role from girl , interrupted .  and the only real " crazy " to be found in the film is director gary fleder's ( things to do in denver when you're dead ) staggering use of flashback sequences .  oliver platt , famke janssen , and even sean bean are decent actors , but the stuff they are given here -- such as a bedridden wife fighting off the token black guy with her crutch -- is insulting and demeaning .  additionally , the use of the surveillance cameras and laptops to track nathan's every move is downright unbelievable .  how do ex-cons fresh out of the big house afford all this equipment ?  despite its flaws , don't say a word is surprisingly some of the best mainstream film you'll find this month -- and audiences will lap it up .  americans love lukewarm , half-baked thrillers starring big names and accompanied by cheap thrills .  someone get me my lithium !  
i'm not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing " disturbing behavior " with " scream . "  maybe it's because they're both horror films ( kinda ) , both have hot young stars , both have an annoying alternative soundtrack , and both are aimed at the teenage crowd , which i guess includes me .  but this is not the next in line with the " scream " flicks as well as the " i know what you did last summer " soon to be flicks .  it owes less to " halloween " and more to kafka and orwell , which , in my book , makes for a more interesting feature .  and it should have been .  this is basically a rehash of " the stepford wives , " the great 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross and dealing , as i've been told , with a bunch of women who are programmed to be perfect housewives .  or something like that .   " behavior , " starring katie holmes of " dawson's creek , " deals with a bunch of teenagers , deep in angst , who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers .  suck-ups .  preppies .  it actually , at least to me , sounds like it would work , and with scott rosenberg , that witty penmen who has written stuff like " beautiful girls " and " things to do in denver when you're dead " ( as well as " con air " ) , it actually sounds like it may be pulled off with the right amount of frights and satiric wit .  alas , it's not , and it plumets into that little group of movies known as " the movies with potential that blow it . "  i remember a film called " white man's burden " which dealt with a reversal of blacks and whites in society that did nothing with it's potentially brilliant premise .  here's another one .  it could be a brilliant satire on how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order to find themselves .  it's a stage , and this film does in fact realize that .  it gets its message across and it does it effortlessly .  now it just needs to work as a film .  which it doesn't .  it's too sloppy and too contrived .  it paints a bleak portrait of high school life . . . then  lets it lie .  it brings us a bunch of scary monsters who are all a bunch of disgustingly icky kiss-ups who do food drives and hang out at a 50s diner drinking milk shakes . . . then  gives it a cheap twist : when they get horny , they become homicidal .  isn't it scary enough that they're like this , and can't the real terror in the town be that you could be next to be just like them - not that you could be next to die ?  the film introduces us two three different characters who , in the beginning , are considered outsiders because they're not ( yet ) part of this clique : the new kid , steve ( james marsden - dull dull dull dull ) , who's having trouble at home because he hasn't gotten over his brother's ( ethan embry , in quick flashes so you don't recognize him - i did ) suicide ; the renegade girl , rachel ( katie holmes , from " dawson's creek " ) , who's chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring ; and by far the most interesting kid , gavin ( nick stahl , the kid from " the man without a face " ) , who's the most interesting because he's the only character who's given some dimension .  in the film's best scene , he introduces steve to every single clique , nailing each one's fetishes and hang-ups , and it's the best scene in the movie because it's witty , satirical , and interesting - something the rest of this film isn't .  gavin suspects there's something awry with the preppie kids , known as the blue ribbons , and in the tradition of all conspirators , and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve , he's only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff .  here , we have another case of " the idiot plot , " where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him , but he may have saved this film from being the dreary , dull film that it is without gavin , who gives it life and humor .  the only other half-interesting character is the school janitor , played by william sadler as a retarded , scary guy who may not be what he seems to be . . . but  really , we don't care anyway .  i probably shouldn't mention that this was directed by david nutter , who's works for " the x-files , " because that would probably tarnish his reputation .  like the show , he's good at setting up weird conspiracies , and creating a general creepy feel .  most of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect , and some of it works .  but what this film is not so good at is coming out with a good payoff .  he keeps too much inside , so much that when the characters journey to a mental institution in the third act , you wonder why they just don't get the hell out of there .  i think what happens to gavin is proof enough that there's something rotten in the state of teen angstdom .  what this film needs to be is a lot longer , a lot more colorful , and a lot creepier .  if the best villain they can come up with is a guidance counselor ( played by bruce greenwood , an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay the rent ) who still thinks he can get away with it even when most is revealed , then they need to come up with a tougher , smarter villain .  if he's so villainous , then why could two dense teenagers who couldn't figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in a couple minutes ?  the film , which runs about 80 or so minutes , just needs to work on these things , and become a lot less sloppy .  at such a short running time and with such lame , boring characters as these , it's pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves a horribly unsatisfied taste in one's mouth , especially mine .  
while watching loser , it occurred to me that amy heckerling's true genius as a film-maker is casting .  in fast times at ridgemont high , she gave us sean penn's jeff spicoli ; in look who's talking , she turned bruce willis into a wise-cracking baby and provided john travolta with is first career revival ; in clueless , she found a star vehicle for the adorableness that is ( or was ) alicia silverstone .  she seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws .  unfortunately , she may also be starting to understand that she understands .  giving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies .  giving appealing actors a script in which their appeal _is_ the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser .  naturally , heckerling makes her protagonist an all-around swell guy .  paul tannek ( jason biggs ) is a small-town boy who gets a scholarship to nyu , then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence in the cold-hearted big city .  paul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman ; his roommates adam ( zak orth ) , chris ( tom sadoski ) and noah ( jimmi simpson ) are the kind of guys who blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over paul .  paul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from afar , in this case the lovely dora diamond ( mena suvari ) .  dora has problems of her own , including a shortage of funds to pay her tuition and a relationship with a professor , edward alcott ( greg kinnear ) , that's more than slightly one-sided .  they're two conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people , so clearly they belong together , even if paul is a loser .  i must confess that , for a while , i was suckered in by heckerling's casting .  jason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace ; suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence .  they're pleasant enough to watch , and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists aren't .  then it gradually becomes clear that there's virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort .  in theory , loser is a romantic comedy , but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire film ( notable exception : a cameo by a scene-stealing comic actor as a video store clerk ) .  instead of taking any time to make the characters' situations funny , heckerling spends 98 minutes making her characters' situations pathetic .  she shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless , nor any of that film's interest in lively plotting ( not surprisingly , since clueless's plot came via jane austen's emma ) .  she simply turns the film into a pity party .  since loser is a film composed almost entirely of establishing character , you might think that those characters would be interesting , or at least slightly complicated .  instead , you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there's no reason to watch them .  paul isn't just a nice guy , he's flawless ; consequently , he's a central character who does absolutely no growing .  his roommates aren't just inconsiderate , they're actively evil-blackmailing professor alcott , drugging women with rohypnol and generally giving humanity a bad name .  and professor alcott isn't just manipulative , he turns dora into his house slave .  dora's unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser , and even that isn't explored in sufficient detail .  there's more ambiguity in the 30-second snippet from alan cumming's broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser it's one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations ; it's another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush .  and it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow . . .  i don't know . . .  comic .  still , i spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora .  that hope dissolved the moment heckerling underscored a sequence of paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon and garfunkel's " scarborough fair/canticle . "  instead of giving the sequence a knowing wink-a reference to the graduate , a hint that paul is becoming an overly-sensitive clich-heckerling plays it deadly straight .  even in the scenes that scream for a light comic touch and a bit of a poke at her protagonist's foibles , she finds it impossible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint .  clueless's cher had her self-absorption and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness .  in loser , amy heckerling shows a leaden hand with material that demands friskiness ( her one show of wit involves naming paul's dorm " hunt's hall " after erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall ) .  her gift with casting proved to be her curse .  loser may be a crashing bore , but gee , aren't those two kids swell ?  
this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bont's debut as a director , 1994 surprise hit speed .  but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead .  annie ( sandra bullock ) is in the wrong place at the wrong time again .  she's going on a cruise with her new boy-friend alex ( jason patric ) , and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger ( willem dafoe ) who has a bone to pick with the shipping line .  they sacked him after he got sick .  now he wants the diamonds stored in the ship's safe for compensation .  that actually is the whole storyline .  speed 2 could do without dialogues .  the movie is all about images and remarkable sound .  i don't really know why this is called an action movie .  except for a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the 70ies .  first we are introduced to a number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie .  then desaster strikes .  sandra bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action this time around .  i looked for the " action " but couldn't find it .  most of the time she is part of the decoration .  the only time she is part of what happens is when she can have a shot at defusing a bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind a fire door .  now we know that she can handle a chain saw .  we also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds .  the bomb defusal of course goes wrong , but only the furniture is damaged , not our heroes who still are needed .  jason patric alias alex spends most of his time flirting with annie , helping other passengers and frolicking in the water .  his initial sea-sickness is suddenly gone , because there are ship , crew and passengers to be saved from evil geiger .  he does a pretty good job but i can't blame keanu reeves for declining this part .  then there's willem dafoe , the villain , who desperately tries to look as frightening as frankenstein's monster .  he doesn't succeed , though .  an untidy appearance isn't enough to convince the viewer of his psychopath potential .  before he tries again to make us believe he is a dangerous man he should practise for a while in front of a mirror .  i can't really recommend speed 2 . you will probably like the movie if you like funny situations that aren't meant to be funny .  especially the showdown , when the ship first runs into an oil tanker and then dissembles a whole village is a treat .  there you get to see the most superfluous scene in the movie .  in keeping with last year's desaster movie tradition a dog is miraculously saved from certain death .  a really funny ( and meant to be funny ) scene takes place on the oil tanker right before the collision .  some crew members watch two ships colliding in an old movie .  had they looked out the window they wouldn't have missed the huge ship racing toward them .  those of you who still want to see the movie should pick a theater with a large screen and a good sound system to enjoy the visual effects and the phantastic surround sound effects .  in an adequately equipped theater it's as if the explosion were going off all around you and you can feel the seats vibrate .  but the ilm special effects can't save the movie .  for all the money they could have done better .  
i never understood what the clich ? " hell on earth " truly meant until very recently .  i've just never experienced anything in my life which was so terrifying , so horrible , so monstrously deplorable that it justified being termed as " hell on earth " .  after all , i've never been to war , i've never been the victim of any violent crime , i've never really been broken hearted , and i've never been audited ; so i really had no frame of reference as to people meant when they said that something was " hell on earth "  then i saw cruel intentions .  in a perfect world , i would be in charge of all the movie studios .  the very first thing i'd do in this perfect world , would be to take every hollywood producer who thinks that setting any story in contemporary america with a 20-something cast playing teenagers and featuring a soundtrack ripped directly from mtv , and throw them in jail .  but it wouldn't just be your average jail , not even a maximum security installation .  i'd have these producers ( and everyone else involved in the production of these films ) put in front of a war crimes tribunal and forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity .  now you're probably thinking to yourself : " is this really how bad cruel intentions is ? "  the answer is no .  it's actually much worse .  watching the cast of this motion picture atrocity try to act their way through roger kumble's awfully written script is probably a lot like stabbing yourself in the arm with a chainsaw and then pouring salt on the open wound .  and then pouring acid on the salt .  i don't know if kumble was trying to evoke comedy or tragedy out of his opening scene where marci greenbaum ( tara reid ) whines about having nude photos of her posted on the internet , but the only emotion i felt was sheer boredom .  from that opening scene , where boring actor ryan phillippe tries to seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz , to the conclusion which i don't remember because i had practically fallen asleep ; cruel intentions is truly " hell on earth , " right up there with war and tax audits .  
the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as 'anywhere but here . '  there isn't one thing about this mother-daughter relationship melodrama that felt honest .  it relies on a contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughter what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives , as for some reason they couldn't figure it out for themselves .  if the film looks familiar , that is because " the slums of beverly hills ( 98 ) " went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances , in which they were fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with .  alvin sargent's script was weak and annoyingly claustral .  wayne wang's ( " the joy luck club " ) inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldn't convey .  pushy mother adele august ( susan sarandon ) forces her 14-year-old daughter ann ( natalie portman ) to leave a small midwestern burg to go cross-country with her to beverly hills .  the daughter resents her twice divorced , unstable but exotic , schoolteacher mother , bullying her to be an actress as a means of escaping a humdrum life .  the daqughter doesn't even like the used gold mercedes mother buys to drive to lala land in and can't stand the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio .  so it becomes a question of who knows best , as the ladies fight it out between them , until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner .  adele's dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon doesn't look that good , as she lands a job in a slum school , has her precious car scratched by the unruly kids , and settles into a job she hates in order to financially survive .  daughter pines for small town wisconsin and her friends there .  during one of many arguments with her free-spirited mom , they go for ice cream and while mother is being ticketed , she runs away , only to be chased down by friendly traffic cop ( michael milhoan ) , who offers her wise counsel .  with the cop's zen wisdom passed onto the daughter , she will survive living in many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches 17 and then she plans to get way from mom by using her good grades to go to brown university instead of ucla .  during their stay in beverly hills , she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high to immediately having many high school girlfriends and even a high school rich boy admirer-- a t . s .  eliot ( corbin allred ) reader .  but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality , as everything seemed staged and unemotional .  when she learns her cousin benny ( shawn hatosy ) , who happens to be her best friend dies in a traffic accident back in wisconsin , she returns for the funeral and in those reunion scenes it wasn't clearly shown why she wants to stay there , and for that matter , it was never made clear why the mother wants to leave so badly .  the film is one big battle of wills between mother and daughter over their dreams .  i guess what the filmmaker is trying to say , is that mom is a bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one , able to recognize mother's faults when not in growing pains and in need of parenting herself .  mother has a series of setbacks , like being dumped by her dream-boat dentist ( bochner ) she met on the beach , and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part .  but mother learns that her daughter has grown-up and is independent and that she has to stop living her life through her .  she learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what to do , is about to ticket her and this time will remind the mother of the right thing to do .  this of course results in the corny ending , showing that mom's heart was always in the right place , only she went about it in the wrong way .  this was just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater where this film is showing .  
i think maybe it's time for the batman series to be put to rest .  not only has the first two films' unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone to make himself into a " superhero " been abandoned , but this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for all-out camp with few traces of the self-mocking restraint of the relatively light-hearted third installment .  let me give you an example : in the first scene of the movie , batman ( george clooney ) and robin ( chris o'donnell ) are summoned to a museum that has been literally turned to ice by mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) in an attempt to steal a diamond .  mr . freeze's thugs are armed with none other than hockey sticks , but this is no problem for our heroes : automatic skates shoot out of their shoes , at which point robin manages to get hold of a hockey stick , grabs the diamond , and stick-handles it through the museum .  i might have expected this from an airplane-style farce , but i don't think that's what this movie is supposed to be .  after all , the previous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic by the standards of the superhero/action genre and kept the corny death-defying stunts to a minimum , while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony .  not any more ; the list goes on and on in this one .  robin holds onto the outside of a flying rocket ship 30 , 000 feet high in the atmosphere , climbing in the door to save batman .  mr . freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) leap from a skyscraper and survive by landing in a small pond .  a world dominating mad scientist lives in a fortress that seems to have been stolen from the old he-man cartoons .  my very favorite example is the scene in which batgirl ( alicia silverstone ) gets in a race with motorcycle thugs , during which they come up with the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline and setting it on fire to distract her .  not bad , but wouldn't the police ( or maybe batman ? )  notice if the road was on fire ?  i knew gotham city was this crazy anarchic place , but .   .   .   .  it also seems that the creators of the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule that there have to be more main characters and plot lines in each successive installment .  as if three protagonists and two villains weren't enough , batman and robin further weighs itself down with an underdeveloped side story of the failing health of bruce wayne's butler alfred ( michael gough ) , which might have seemed poignant if it wasn't surrounded by so much silliness , as well as several scenes with elle macpherson as bruce's girlfriend which serve no purpose other than to remind us that she is in the movie .  all this might be semi-excusable if the story were interesting and entertaining , but it isn't .  in fact , it's kind of boring .  mr . freeze and poison ivy pale in comparison as villains to past baddies such as jack nicholson's joker and danny devito's penguin .  their evil plot is as predictable ( schwarzenegger actually pronounces the words , " today gotham city , tomorrow the world ! " )  as it is lame-brained ( didn't it ever occur to poison ivy that freezing the entire world would kill her precious plants too ? ) .  and robin's constant challenging of batman mostly just makes him look bull-headed and stupid and makes us wonder why batman ever would have taken him on as a partner in the first place .  strip away the stars , the fancy set design , and the status as a " batman movie , " and all you have here is another barely passable summer action flick .  
house on haunted hill ( 1999 ) starring taye diggs , geoffrey rush , ali larter , famke janssen , peter gallagher , bridgette wilson , max perlich , lisa loeb , james marsters , and chris kattan .  directed by william malone , written by dick beebe ,   " house on haunted hill " initializes itself to the audience with a scene involving zombie-like mental patients attacking and murdering doctors in the goriest ways possible .  one doctor is killed instantly after having a pencil rammed completely through his neck .  a nurse has her head forced into a barrel of water .  these mobs of zombies presented are like those in previous b-horror flicks , with grunting noises and cadaverous movements .  except this time , at the end of the millenium , the film is given the power to show exactly how horrific these creatures can be .  in past horror films , the actual murder scenes are left out or not shown forcing the viewer to assume their own nasty bloody deaths for the hapless victims .   " house on haunted hill " doesn't want their audience to have an imagination , everything is provided for them to watch and squirm , not think .  this nonsense violence thrown out of nowhere is unfortunately the most refreshing part about this film .   " house on haunted hill " , which is based on the 1958 film of the same title , introduces a handful of characters as quickly as it can , following the opening blood fest .  the film has no intention of providing character development or a laudable plot .  the aim here is to scare the audience with chilling , unexpected shots of blood , guts , and mayhem .  however , the film is neither scary nor unpredictable .  the plot involves five people who are dared to spend the night in a haunted house for one million dollars by an amusement park owner ( geoffrey rush ) .  each character is a failure in the external world and acknowledges that they would do anything for that money .  since the characters are immediately generalized as either greedy or caring , the expectations of who will survive or not is killed five minutes after you meet them .  the problem is that every character is not likable .  the two who come closest to being civilized are a womanizer ( taye diggs - who should be doing films a lot better than this with all of his talent ) and a businesswoman who accepts being womanized ( ali larter ) .  the characters presented are so annoying and pathetic , that it is hard to cheer for them or scream them .  the worst character in this film , or maybe in any film released this year , is chris kattan's watson pritchett .  he spends the whole film whining about the spooky house in a tone so irritating and inappropriate , that he unintentionally begins to seem more evil than the house itself .  waiting for pritchett to die , was a strenuously difficult act to sit through .  the most humorous actor of the bunch is geoffrey rush playing steven price ( an homage to victor price who starred in the original ) .  playing the rich man who supposedly organized the party , he plays the role perfectly in a twisted way where it is obvious that he is up to something just by the expressions on his face .  however , rush is pretty much wasted in a confusing subplot involving a hateful marriage with evelyn price , played by famke janssen .  the main problem is that " house on haunted hill " is not scary .  to top off that huge disappointment , every actor was wasted and the script was completely ludicrous .  if the annoying characters and hilariously bad dialogue were intentionally underdeveloped ( similar to " deep blue sea " ) , the goal for creating a creepy , suspenseful action film was completely missed .  
 " virus " is the type of cliched , vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it .  strangely enough , on the same mid-january weekend last year , another film was released like this , " deep rising , " about an ugly monster on a cruise liner .  prior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989's " leviathan , " 1989's " deep star six , " and all four " alien " pictures .   " virus , " in comparison , is a servicable thriller , well-made and produced , but since it doesn't include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence , it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on .  based on a series of comic books , " virus " concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat , which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon .  after discovering that the boat is slowly sinking , ( un ) lucky for them , a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen .  once the team reaches the russian ship , they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted .  after turning the power back on , however , there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship , and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself .  one survivor finally does turn up , nadia ( joanna pacula ) , who informs the suicidal and stern captain ( donald sutherland ) and one of the crew , kit foster ( jamie lee curtis ) , that a mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship , taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out .  if " virus " sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies , you're correct .  although the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life , the film itself doesn't appear to have a brain in its head .  the film sticks so close to the worn-out conventions of the " creature " genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film .  the actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past , but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play .  in her second return to horror in the last year , jamie lee curtis once again proves to be a strong and resourceful heroine , but that is about it .  although 1998's " halloween : h20 " was also a disappointment , at least she was given a few scenes to develop a character , unlike here .  donald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films , such as 1994's " the puppet masters , " although i just watched him in the superb 1978 sci-fi classic " invasion of the body snatchers , " where he was fabulous .  the last of the three top-billers is william baldwin , but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture , since he has nothing to do .  basically , " virus " is another one of those films where a group of people walk around and investigate a space ship/ocean liner/haunted house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them one-by-one .  it is not the worst of its type , but it is far from one of the best , and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this ?  as long as some of them keep making money , i suspect the answer is never .  
possibly the years the most anticipated film and finally it arrives here in the uk .  it smashed u . s box office office records in it's opening weekend and will no doubt do the same here .  but is it any good ?  in a word , no .  i'll elaborate further .  the story is as follows .  apparently there were two islands with dinosaurs on .  one where the dinos lived untouched by mankind and the other a tourist attraction which failed before it even opened .   ( see jurrasic park . )  imgen , the company that funded jurrasic park , want to reccover their losses by taking more dinos off the other island and move them to a new attraction in san diago .  realizing what a bad idea this is , proffessor john hammond ( richard attenborough ) decides to send a team to document the dinosaurs , so as to rally public support to preserve the island .  enter familiar mumbling man jeff goldblum who only agrees to go when told his girlfriend is already there .  so , basically , what you have is this .  two teams , one sent to catch and move some dinosaurs to the mainland and the other , trying to document them , being forced to work together , fighting for survival against the dinosaurs' firm intentions on eating them .  a fairly good idea , however it's let down by one slight problem .  it's crap .  over two hours of chase scenes gets way too boring , way too quiclky .  add to this a terrible script and some feeble attempts at some occasional characterisation and you end up very disinterested .  it becomes background noise while your mind starts concentrating on things like , 'what's for tea ? ' and 'should you cut the lawn later ? '   ( yes , you should ) .  it's a shame then really , that spielberg has lowered himself into making what essentially is a blatant cash in , which adds practically nothing to the far superior jurrasic park .  with only a few creative and genuinely tense scenes and fabulous c . g . i  dinosaurs ( the t . rex's have to be seen to be believed ) , there is nothing else to recommend the lost world .  a very dissapointing sequel , indeed .  
according to hitchcock and various other filmmakers , isolated motels , diners , gas stations and similar establishments in american southwest can be rather dangerous place for weary travellers .  at the beginning of eye of the storm , 1991 german- american thriller directed by yuri zeltser , one of such places becomes deadly for their owners who get murdered during the stick up .  ten years later their son steven ( played by bradley gregg ) , who was blinded during the incident , still runs motel together with his older brother ray ( played by craig sheffer ) .  hardly anything happens there until alcoholic and abusive william gladstone ( played by dennis hopper ) gets stranded there with his attractive wife sandra ( played by lara flynn boyle ) .  their unexpected presence creates the chain of the events that would end in bloodshed .  yuri zeltser , author of this film , was obviously inspired by hitchcock's psycho , but he chose to add some new and potentially interesting elements to the original plot .  instead of norman bates we have two brothers - one of them traumatised physically , another mentally .  sexual tension between beautiful female patron and shy motel clerk is heightened with the presence of alcoholic husband .  eye of the storm is impressive in visual sense , with photography by karl walter lindenlaub providing a lot of claustrophobic atmosphere .  the acting is fine - hopper , gregg and boyle are comfortable with their roles , but sheffer at times overacts his psycho routine .  unfortunately , eye of the storm , which was supposed to be intense psychological drama , deteriorates into cheap and predictable slasher flick during melodramatic finale .  in the end , this film reminds us that original approach can't prevent filmmakers from wasting too many opportunities .   ( special note to the profiler fans : ally walker appears in the beginning of the film in the small role of killer's girlfriend . )  
weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg's reliance on formulas , _saving private ryan_ is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches .  there ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics .  spielberg's greatest strength as a director is the polished , formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story .  but for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war ( or the holocaust ) this technique backfires , for it creates coherent , comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size , complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken .  in this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films .  _saving private ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a " pr mission " to pull a young man , ryan ( whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere ) out of combat on the normandy front just after d-day .  ryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers .  the search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france .  there's no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie .  the equipment , uniforms and weapons are superbly done .  the opening sequence , in which captain miller ( tom hanks ) leads his men onto omaha beach , is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat .  another pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg's brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences , such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers , the banality of death in combat , the routine foul-ups in the execution of the war , and the cynicism of the troops .  the technical side of the film is peerless , as always .  the camera work is magnificent , the pacing perfect , the sets convincing , the directing without flaw .  hanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance , which was utterly convincing , and the supporting cast was excellent , though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel .  yet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events .  it has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film , or the story fails to convince .  throughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices ( exception : men are shown burning to death with relative frequency ) .  for example , we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground .  here and there men lose limbs ; in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety , there's an explosion , and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half a man .  but the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact .  there are no shoes with only feet in them , no limbs scattered everywhere , no torsos without limbs , no charred corpses , and most importantly , all corpses have heads ( in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds ) .  the relentless dehumanization of the war , in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity , is soft-pedaled in the film .  ultimately , _saving private ryan_ bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war .  rather than saying _saving private ryan_ is " realistic , " it would be better to describe it as " having realistic moments . "  another aspect of the " hollywoodization " of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular , the lack of swearing .  anyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war , such as fussell's superb _wartime : understanding and behavior in the second world war_ ( which has an extensive discussion on swearing ) , knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup .   " who is this private ryan that we have to die for him ? "  asks one infantrymen in the group of eight .  rendered in wartime demotic , that should have been expressed as " who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him ? "  or some variant thereof .  conversations should have been literally sprinkled with the " f " word , and largely about ( the search for ) food and sex .  this is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an " r " rating due to violence , so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film .  however , the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic .  the most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg .  he cannot just cede control to the material ; he has to be bigger than it .  as if afraid to let the viewer find their own ( perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear ) emotional foothold in the material , spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had : the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary ( reminscent of the closing scene from _schindler's list ) , the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close ( every bit as bad as schindler's monologue about how his car , tiepin or ring could have saved another jew ) , quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson , captain miller's last words to private ryan , and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain .  that particular subplot is so hokey , so predictable , it nigh on ruins the film .  nowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction of the meaninglessness , stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat ( imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage ) .  because of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii , _saving private ryan_ can only pan for small truths in the shallows .   .  
 * * * the following review contains some harsh language . . .  but what did you expect when you clicked on this title ?   * * *  cast : kristen holly smith , danica sheridan , alex boling , michael dotson , sonya hensley , janet krajeski , sabrina lu , dionysius burbano , calvin grant , jeff b . harmon written and directed by : jeff b . harmon running time : 97 minutes   " the thought of losing you makes me all vomity inside . "  --- blatz balinski ( danica sheridan ) laments the fact that her lesbian lover , april ( kristen holly smith ) , has just received a telegram from her ex-fiance .  isle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about april pfferpot ( smith ) , a resident of the small town of bumfuck , arkansas who is about to get married to high school sweetheart and football hero dick dickson ( michael dotson ) .  when april gets extreme cold feet she runs home , sticks a gun in her mouth , and pulls the trigger .  instead of killing herself , she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos , an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no men are allowed ( except for lance , the homosexual toilet cleaner/slave ) .  april loves her new home and friends , but dick and her parents are not so ready to give her up .  mr . and ms . pfferpot ( director jeff b . harmon and janet krajeski ) decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of dr . sigmoid colon ( also jeff b . harmon ) , who claims he can cure homosexuality .  in actuality , dr . colon is homosexual as well and begins his special " treatment " on dick dickson ( unbeknownst to dick ) .  when april turns down dick's demand for her to return to bumfuck , he decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the isle of lesbos rambo-style .  instead of leveling the place he falls in love with lance ( alex boling ) and the two of them , along with april and her lover blatz , get married .   ( note to the filmmaker : why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that i'm assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided ? )  april's parents , feeling like there is no recourse , call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb ( whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer ) their way .  the bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the " circuitry " and they re-wire it and send it back to washington d . c . , destroying it .  mr . and ms . pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own .  i'm not sure if writer/director/co-star jeff b . harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs .  either way , he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie .  the film opens with a preacher running a small african-american child out of town , and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan ( during a jaunty musical number ) , preceded by remarks about " gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others , such as the jews " .  if harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be , then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film , but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can't help but feel like he had some serious intent .  as for the entire central theme of the movie , i'm afraid that it's one that i just don't get .  i tried to keep an open mind while watching it , but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes .  it was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society .  how does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non-acceptance ?  i'm not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society , but don't force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren't going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me .  again , maybe i'm missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make , but if so , i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully .  as far as musical comedies go , isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical , but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy .  despite the disturbing visuals , " mom and apple pie " stuck with me for the rest of the day .  speaking of disturbing visuals , " wedding bells ain't ringing " could have been a decent song , but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying .   " i'm a lesbian " ( which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular ) is also pretty good , but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms . smith .  it's mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based .  the other performers are decent , save for the rosie o'donnell like performance given by danica sheridan .  i have no inherent problem with her character ; it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired .  one particular musical number , " lesbian rock " , was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my film-going life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan .  the film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll .  the remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs ( " lesbian rock " included ) and the ridiculously presented anti-nukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film .  once the " isle of lesbos reprise " was reached , i felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all .  why was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end ?  isle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www . indie-underground . com .  the transfer is pretty clean ( and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent ) and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1 . 85 : 1 .  in many respects , isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential ( like a rocky horror for the new millennium ) .  this film is by no means my cup of tea , but i know there are those out there who will enjoy it .  if you think it might be for you , then by all means seek it out .  i , on the other hand , will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like gladiator . . .  wait . aren't gladiator films considered to be . . .  oh , never mind .  
synopsis : when a meteorite crashlands in the arizona desert , community college professors ira kane ( duchovny ) and harry block ( jones ) are first on the scene .  they discover that an alien lifeform has arisen from the rock and is evolving at an amazing rate .  soon the army , advised by dr allison reed ( moore ) , moves in and forces kane and block out .  but when the aliens begin to menace society , it may take the scientists' combined efforts to stop them before they terminate the evolution of another lifeform : humanity .  review : " evolution " certainly has the ingredients for a decent comedy .  it's directed by reitman , clearly trying to parlay his " ghostbusters " success into a twenty-first-century counterpart .  it stars duchovny , and although one might question his judgment in lampooning his " x-files " character so soon after leaving the tv series , it should certainly provide him with plenty of ammunition .  and then there's moore , who may not have much prior experience in comedy , but who has certainly proven her ability as an actress .  a shame , then , that it all deteriorates into such a hopelessly unfunny morass .   " evolution " is a movie more concerned with its special effects ( which are quite good ) than anything resembling a consistently funny script .  it has its moments ( a scene in which jones' body is invaded by an alien is particularly entertaining ) , but there are embarrassingly long stretches that are utterly devoid of humour .  moore is totally wasted , her clumsy shtick getting very old , very fast .  duchovny has stunningly little in the way of material to work with .  and the story is so formulaic , it could have been written by monkeys .  part of what made " ghostbusters " so wonderful was a combination of a great script and characters the audience could root for .   " evolution " is so mind-numbingly tedious that it's difficult not to start cheering for the aliens .  
terrence malick made an excellent 90 minute film adaptation of james jones' world war ii novel .  unfortunately , he buried it within an overlong and overreaching 3-hour long pseudo-epic .  this is a shame because the film features an outstanding performance by nick nolte .  the best scene is when nick nolte's character , lt . col . tall , is forced to deal with the direct refusal by capt . staros ( elias koteas ) to execute an order .  nolte's reaction and transformation may be the best work of his career .  had terrence malick concentrated on the great performances of nolte and koteas as well as those by sean penn , woody harrelson , and john cusack , he could have made a truly great film .  instead , malick saddled the film with plodding pacing , unnecessary flashbacks , and a voice-over narration all designed to telegraph the great philosophical underpinnings of the story .  the narration was especially annoying as much of it sounded like very bad high school poetry .  with a lot of editing , the core story could be transformed into a truly classic war film .  hopefully , the dvd version of this film will feature options to suppress the narration , and perhaps will even provide for an alternate , shorter version of the film .  i give this film .  
it's almost amusing to watch 21-year old christina ricci get drastically overshadowed in sally potter's follow-up to 1997's the tango lesson , the man who cried .  the gen-y actress , with her cold stare and big , black eyes , has appeared in an impressive range of films ; but she doesn't even come close to being the bold heroine the film , set against the historical backdrop of world war 2 , requires her to be .  ricci , whose character is shockingly silent and blank , showing only the occasional smile or hint of concern , shares most of her scenes with the astounding cate blanchett : quite an amusing sight to behold .  blanchett's lola , a paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie , is bold , interesting and layered ? everything our heroine lacks .  co-star of the upcoming lord of the rings trilogy , blanchett has a good seven inches on ricci , sports twice the makeup and dons a flashy wardrobe .  the actress inhabits the role ? as she always so remarkably does ? with a fervor and life that makes you want her to hold the screen as the film's lead rather than her dull companion .  important historical events involving hitler and his nazis scatter themselves across the film ; these landmarks serve as the film's little conflict .  obviously , the tables are turned in the life of suzie by these events , whose jewish origin is unknown among her parisian colleagues .  the man who cried has many aspirations , none of which come full circle by the film's close .  there are forced messages here and there : " go forward ; always go forward , " lola preaches to suzie ; there's romance between suzie and a fellow target of hitler's nazis , the gypsy cesar ( johnny depp , who , like ricci , barely gets to speak ) ; lola struggles with her character that desires above all things wealth and men who have it ; and at the core of all these devices lies suzie's desire to travel to america , where her father journeyed after leaving her and her mother years ago .  the film's main problem is that potter isn't skilled enough to tell the epic-sized story of suzie .  the time period's instability , the conflicting social classes , the prejudice against suzie from all those around her in her new life : serving as both writer and director , potter throws in some of each , but hardly an inch of depth is to be found in any .  by the time the sigh-inducing climax hits , the believability and complete absence of focus leave one ready to leave the theater .  the film's falling action is weirdly unsatisfying and unlikely ; are we really meant to believe any of this could happen ?  contrastingly , in its moving final scene , the man who cried strikes a note that is made effective in its ties to the emotional beginning of the film .  although it's apparent that potter can't grasp what she reaches , i'm puzzled as to why she reaches for so much in the first place .  ricci's suzie is meant to be the film's core : from the extended flashback at the film's beginning to the quickly drawn ending , everything seen in the film , in some way , relates to her .  so why then does potter spend so much time on subplots involving other individuals ?  the character of suzie is too present for the man who cried to work as an ensemble , but not present enough for the film to be ricci's .  the almost constant lack of flow and one-note tone with which potter depicts the man who cried are somewhat improved upon by sacha vierny's beautiful cinematography that renders the film's various locations wonderfully .  also worthy of note are lindy hemming's costumes that help to depict the area quite nicely .  and then there's the music .  from minute one to minute ninety-seven , there's hardly a moment when the wavering , skilled voice of an opera singer or the rhythms of the gypsy music don't undercut the action ; the notes stricken both overwhelm ( particularly john turturro , portraying fictional opera singer dante dominio , whose money and reputation catch lola's interest ) and accompany ( oftentimes , the perfect chords are captured to undermine the state of the film's characters and reinforce that state ) .  potter obviously cares much about each and every musical note ; unfortunately , the same effort isn't given towards ( almost ) everything else .  
by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer , it's possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one .  action lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup .  audience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the film's sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending , which is an insulting cop-out .  somewhere out there , maybe there's a small cadre of film-goers who will appreciate sphere's dubious charms , but i'm not among them .  i sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie ( i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham ) , because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by , it's hard to understand why the rights were optioned .  sphere is the kind of first- class mess that only a top-line director with an a-list cast can create .  with expectations high ( and how could they not be , considering that another barry levinson/dustin hoffman collaboration , the excellent wag the dog , is still playing in theaters ? ) ,  something this bad can't help but look even worse .  the last time a big-name , big-budget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last year's batman & robin , and everyone knows how that movie was received .  sphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact and james cameron's the abyss , but , somewhere along the way , it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort , event horizon .  science and philosophy , which are used to good effect during sphere's first hour , give way to mindless , confusing action sequences .  attempts at characterization fall apart .  intelligent writing , which is evident early on , is replaced by hackneyed drivel .  special effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness .  but all that is just in preparation for the ending , which is inexcusably awful .  this is the time-honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect .  i left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film .  there is some promise , but it's all in the setup .  we're introduced to norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) , a psychologist who once wrote a $35 , 000 report for the government about what to do in the event that a crashed space ship is discovered .  when one is found in the middle of nowhere , 1000 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean , norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee .  on the team with him are beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist who was once his student and lover ; harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of 18 ; ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology ; and harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , the government operative in charge of the mission .  together , the five descend into the bowels of the ocean , where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact .  for a while , sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the man-meets-alien situation .  the overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists ( such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship , apparently from the future ) offer intriguing possibilities .  then , right around the one-hour mark ( that's the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatever's left of titanic ) , the virtually non-stop action begins , and , once it starts , the script becomes superfluous .  this might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension , but , instead , he relies on loud , overbearing music , strange camera angles , and quick cuts to make things " exciting . "  additionally , because none of the characters are well-formed ( a common failing in anything penned by crichton , who's more interested in technology than people ) , viewers don't develop much of a rooting interest .  it makes sitting through sphere a frustrating and pointless experience .  what about that a-list cast ?  not surprisingly , the most energetic performance is given by samuel l . jackson , but his harry isn't a person ; he's a walking plot device spouting occasionally-witty dialogue .  dustin hoffman isn't lively or particularly good -- it's ironic that this , which may be his worst work in a decade , has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination ( for wag the dog ) .  sharon stone and peter coyote are both flat .  their characters exhibit little evidence of emotion ; automatons would have been as effective .  then there's queen latifa , who , despite getting fifth billing in the credits ( ahead of liev schreiber , who boasts at least quadruple her screen time ) , has less than a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count .  i like to think that levinson and hoffman , recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be , chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance ( the low-budget picture was filmed during sphere's lengthy pre-production phase ) .  if that's the case , forgiveness is granted .  i'm less inclined to look favorably upon crichton , although he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume ( jurassic park and the levinson-directed disclosure come to mind ) .  even if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process , crichton's credit as a producer disallows him absolution .  he was a willing participant in a creative travesty .  no wonder sphere is being released in february , in the midst of the early year's cinematic wasteland .  it deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic , which should plow sphere under on its way to a ninth-consecutive weekend atop the box office heap .  
one of the first films of 1999 is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek , the star of the wb's runaway hit dawson's creek .  following in the foot steps of mtv's two other live action films , joe's apartment ( 1996 ) and dead man on campus ( 1998 ) , varsity blues is a bad film and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace .  set in west cannan , texas , the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john " mox " moxon ( van der beek ) .  we know he's smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook .  coach bud kilmer ( jon voight ) has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him .  the star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , is a handsome , blonde , hero who has his own billboard in his front yard and dates the sexy head cheerleader , darcy ( ali larter ) .  also on the team are an enormous guy ( ron lester ) with some health problems and the token african-american team member ( eliel swinton ) whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin .  when lance is seriously injured , mox gets his chance to shine and he runs with it , undermining kilmer with his unusual playing strategies .  his relationship with his dutiful girlfriend , jules ( amy smart ) , is threatened and there's a big game at the end .  guess who wins ?  nothing about varsity blues is inspired and the whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love .  there's a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow .  van der beek does a decent job of carrying his first film although a silly accent trips him up sometimes .  also , the role isn't very much of a stretch from his dawson leary character .  he's still a pseudo-intellectual , whiny , nice guy , except here he also happens to be a jock .  voight is a terror as he chews up every single piece of scenery and spits it out .  the other adults are all notably awful while the younger performers don't fare much better .  on the positive side , walker is a charismatic actor who is due for a breakout role following this and his supporting turn in pleasantville ( 1998 ) .  scott ( son of james ) caan has some lively moments as tweeder , the team's wild man .  larter , as a gorgeous seductress looking for a one way ticket out of texas , gets to show off the film's most interesting costumes , including a very eye-opening " whipped cream bikini . "  it's interesting to note that the film definitely earns its r-rating with a lot of harsh language , alcohol abuse and an unusually high amount of nudity ( including a gratuitous trip to a strip bar that reveals a not very surprising surprise ) .  all this is likely to come as a shock to the young female fan base of dawson's creek , presumably the target audience for the picture .  director brian robbins previously helmed the kids feature good burger ( from nickelodeon films , a sister company of mtv ) and changes directions here a bit but still fails to make much of an impression .  the look of the movie is as bland as the town and characters who populate it .  the football scenes are generally unexciting and the entire film looks a bit washed out .  there's an ok soundtrack featuring music from collective soul , foo fighters , green day and aaliyah but it's not as impressive as one would expect from a mtv film .  
its a stupid little movie that trys to be clever and sophisticated , yet trys a bit too hard .  with the voices of woody allen , gene hackman , jennifer lopez , sylvester stallone , and sharon stone , this computer-animated yak-fest ( think toy story [1996] filled with used merchandising ) is one for the ant-eaters .  the main story is the independence of a worker named z ( allen ) .  he wants more to life than just digging away underground for the colony .  when he finds out about ``insectopia , " a mythical place where all insects can run free , z , along with his colony's princess ( stone ) , journey out into the world to find a meaning for life .  about 15 minutes into the picture , i began to wonder what the point of the film was .  halfway through , i still didn't have an answer .  by the end credits , i just gave up and ran out .  antz is a mindless mess of poor writing and even poorer voice-overs .  allen is nonchalant , while i would have guessed , if i hadn't seen her in the mighty and basic instinct , stone can't act , even in a cartoon .  this film is one for the bugs : unfunny and extremely dull .  hey , a bug's life may have a good time doing antz in .  
if there's one thing i just can't stand , it's a film that oozes with sentimentality .  here's a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves .  swelling , saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy , and that the situation is hopeless .  alas , my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up .  what reminded me was that i wasn't choked up , or even the slightest bit moved , for that matter .  my giant is a forced , contrived , and conspicuously un-cute ( i detest the word " cute " but i've chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a " cute " film here ) .  it takes a premise that might have been interesting ( i liked the preview ) , and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches , all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience .  maybe it will work for some people .  it didn't work for me .  billy crystal plays sam cayman , an agent who , at the beginning of the film , is in romania .  he's in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film .  the screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired , get in a car accident , and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall .  his name is max ( gheorghe muresan ) , and sam thinks he'd be a great movie star because of his size .  subplots are as follows : sam has a son and a wife ( kathleen quinlan ) , and he's never around for them , so they move to chicago .  max is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins .  sam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money , and so their various subplots can all be resolved .  sam is broke .  max is dying .  pass the kleenex .  my giant , as a comedy , is only moderately funny .  it has its moments , the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself .  in one great scene , sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal ; of course , his son doesn't believe that he's actually speaking to seagal , and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is ( i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect ) .  crystal is always entertaining , and he has a few good lines here ( some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely ) ; often , however , he's countered by a slew of jokes that aren't funny , and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes .  muresan is kind of fun to watch , but he just can't act very well .  quinlan , on the other hand , is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents .  she was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown , but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff .  here , the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent .  all of these disappointing ingredients create a film that , for much of its running time , is simply mediocre .  as my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion , however , director michael lehmann ( who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk ) and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable , each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings .  sam's multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed ( how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family ? ) .  later , it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sam's reunion with his family .  and some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing , but i had a few morality problems with it ( and i apologize for being vague ) .  it's icky .  it drips with gooey , wannabe human emotions .  my giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film .  more importantly , it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is .  instead , it's a complicated , overlong , and under-engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears .  and since it left me feeling completely unmoved , i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world .  
 " have you ever heard the one about a movie so bad that it made a guy run out of the theatre screaming ? "  obviously the producers at columbia tristar did not think that we suffered enough from the first installment , and so to finish us utterly , they have now released " urban legends : final cut " .  this is another " scream " -like feature , consisting merely from the recycled materials of rip-offs from the most pointless movies of all time .  amy ( jennifer morrison ) is a film student who is attending a film school filled with uninspired film students who do not have a clue about what to do .  but just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious university's film program -- where each year's best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize , a virtual one-way ticket to hollywood success -- she has a chance encounter with campus security guard reese ( loretta devine ) , whose tale of a series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her hand at a fictional thriller organized along similar lines .  soon enough , fake -- and real -- blood starts to flow , and amy is being chased around by scary killer , while her cast and crew get slain , one by one .  is the culprit the original urban legends murderer , just some random psycho , !  a member of the faculty , one of her competitors for the hitchcock , or is there something even more stupid going on ?  this is another one of those tiring , pointless teen slasher flicks : neither scary , funny , or interesting .  it simply lacks the ability and the story to entertain .  the body counts and screams continue to grow , as the weak level of intelligence sinks rapidly .  in fact watching films like that after having watched " scary movie " is impossible keeping a serious face .  several times i tried to prevent myself from laughing , without succeeding .  and then i realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing .  it's the same thing that has been told and told and told over and over again as if it was the revelation of the century .  how many times must we tolerate the same clich ? s that have haunted the slasher genre since its birth ?  it has been so many films about masked killers that most of us have developed an allergy for them .  they are the most stupid , meaningless , predictable and soulless films in existence .  however , director john ottman manages to make " urban legends : final cut " into one of the worst achievements of this godforsaken genre .  what was done with a sense of redemption for past failures and irony in " scream " , ottman takes seriously .  for that reason alone , it is worth a look , just to realize how bad a movie can be .  it's tough to find comparisons for such an achievement , and we have to dig in ancient history to find a movie that would match its intellect .  even movies like " lost in space " and " mission to mars " seem spectacular in its shadow .  we have not seen such waste of t !  ime and resources since " showgirls " ( 1995 ) .  no matter how hard i tried to find positive elements in this so called production , i came up with nothing , except the way the killer was dressed .  here i feel that i have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker and marie-sylvie deveu , that have wisely replaced the well known scream-mask with a very elegant fencing mask .  jennifer morrison ( " stir of echoes " ) is all right , and the other actors' best achievement is keeping a straight face when pronouncing the words from the script .  in fact the only thing that is terrifying about this film ( with the exception of its screenplay ) is its portray of film schools .  if these graduates will be the directors of the future , then hollywood's golden days are over .  rumors are already spreading through the internet that columbia tristar is already developing a third installment .  let's just hope and pray that it's just an urban legend .  
plot : upon the realization that they are failing all of their classes , two roommates try to find a third roomie who will kill himself , since the school's charter automatically grants top grades to the roommates of any student who succeeds in suicide .  critique : despite this film's interesting premise and dark subject matter , this movie sucks because it is unfunny , boring , and presents us with one of tom everett scott's worst acting performances .  add that to a completely unsuccessful romance element , many lame and corny jokes , a long wait for the setup , and an ending that takes all the blackness out of this " black comedy " ( if you're gonna create a black comedy , don't chicken out in the end-see very bad things ( 8/10 ) for a perfect example ) , and you've got yourself a trite mtv creation worthy of its own subject matter .  i barely laughed at any gags , found the bong element contrived and repetitive , and was horrified not to find any gratuitous nudity tossed anywhere in this movie ( if you're gonna make a bad college comedy , at least slap in some free t&a shots for the kids : ) .  this one's not even worth the rental , fellas .  skip it altogether !  little known facts about this film and its stars : during auditions for that thing you do ! , tom everett scott's first feature film role , director tom hanks was opposed to hiring tom because of the fact that scott could've passed for hanks 15 years ago .  it wasn't until hanks' wife rita wilson saw the audition tape , and decided he was cute , that hanks decided to risk hiring scott .  the actor who played scott cooper in this film , mark-paul gosselaar , is best known for having played the character of zack morris on tv's " saved by the bell " .  his parents are dutch and named hans and paula .  and who would've guessed that this is director alan cohn's first shot at directing a feature film ?  
plot : token director alan smithee steals the only copy of his film " trio " from the studio , after they complete the " final cut " without him .  he threatens to burn the film reel if they do not allow him to keep his vision .  critique : wow .  i really can't remember the last time a movie sucked on so many levels !  the " comedy " in this film is pathetic , obvious and dated ( oj simpson jokes galore ) .  the plot is uninteresting , boring and bad .  the structure of the film is annoying , repetitive and pretentious .  the acting is pretty bad , especially jackie chan , who can't act to save his life .  the cameos are lame and seem forced , and the ending blows chunks .  all in all , this movie believes itself to be a clever , humorous and edgy look behind the closed doors of hollywood , but comes across as a boring , stupid and completely unentertaining piece of shite .  i love to see movies about hollywood shenanigans , but this one bites the big one .  see it if you like to watch really bad movies , otherwise skip it , because it will just have you hating every star that makes an appearance in it .  luckily for us all , this mess only lasts about 80 minutes , and miramax honcho harvey weinstein plays a lead-faced detective .  by the way , is there any reason why the studio or the producer couldn't have cut another version of the film by the way of all the filmed stock that was left over ?  who knows , who cares , this " satire " sucks the bag .  little known facts about this film and its stars : ironically , the original director of this film , arthur hiller , also requested his name be taken off the credits and replaced by the dga's alan smithee moniker .  this was after the film's production company , cinergi pictures , preferred the cut made by producer/writer joe eszterhas to his .  the original script of this film included arnold schwarzenegger and bruce willis .  eszterhas announced through the media during post-production that cinergi pictures didn't have the money to pay for soundtrack .  he said that he would finance the soundtrack from his own money and asked to submit tracks for it to him .  he received 9 , 200 cds and cassettes from mostly unknown and unsigned artists , listened to all that was sent ( at least a couple of tracks from each record ) and compiled the soundtrack .  this film practically swept the " razzie awards " in 1999 , given out to the worst of all movie categories of the year , with no less than the " worst picture " award , the " worst screenplay " ( joe eszterhas ) , the " worst supporting actor " ( joe eszterhas ) , the " worst new star " ( joe eszterhas tied with jerry springer ) and the " worst original song " ( " i wanna be mike ovitz ! "  as written by joe eszterhas ) .  
conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that children's items begin to dramatically escalate in price about twenty-five or thirty years after the item was made .  that's when the kids of that time have jobs , disposable income and a desire to re-visit the awe and wonderment of childhood that has disappeared from their lives .  check out the prices of toys from the late sixties and you'll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks .  there's a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and early seventies and nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen .  boomers are now mostly in their forties and fifties and have lived in the work-a-day world for a long time .  they'd like to re-capture some of that fun they remember from days of yore .  hollywood seems more than eager to churn out product to help them .  directors are zealous to put their stamp on icons from that time .  and for the most part they're messing it up .   " mission impossible " , " lost in space " , " godzilla " , " zorro " .  none of these successfully capture the originals .  none of these are even good films .  you can now add " the avengers " to the list .  the british television series began in 1961 .  super secret agent john steed ( then-patrick macnee ) and his third partner , emma peel ( then-diana rigg ) are the pair that the american audience fell for .  surrealistic and witty , the series fit the mood of the times .  the leather-clad rigg probably didn't hurt the ratings either .  after all it's not a coincidence that you can't pronounce her character's name without " appeal " .  now we're in the nineties .  steed ( now-ralph fiennes ) and peel ( now-uma thurman ) are battling evil genius sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) who is screwing with england's weather .  that's about as much of a plot as we have .  there's some footage about a lot of other things that either don't make sense or make even less sense .  we get betrayal for some unknown reason .  evil clones appear and vanish and have no connection to the film .  remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason .  there's a high tech hot air balloon , but i have no idea why anyone's in it .  the spy agency is run by a man called " mother " who is in a wheelchair and a woman named " father " who is blind . . . at  least in some scenes .  there's probably a reason for all of this , but we'll never know it .  macnee makes an appearance of sorts .  he is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing .  a group of villains sits around a table , all clad in huge pastel-colored teddy bear outfits .  at first it's humorous to watch the teddies waddle around , but then it becomes goofy .  the movie is a medley of clutter , confusion and wrong decisions around every corner .  it feels like major portions of the film are missing .  the storyline jumps rather than flows .  reportedly the film was re-cut several times .  this is one of those times where the whole is less than the sum of the parts especially since some of the parts appear to be missing .  there's one good point where peel is running from one room to another in a house designed by escher .  other than that , the effects are second-rate .  the weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes .  thurman almost makes an adequate emma peel but it doesn't work .  she looks good , dresses in all the right fetish outfits but there's no spark .  fiennes fares even less well .  macnee's steed was a witty man of the world with a sense of humor .  fiennes' agent comes across as a dour kid in grown-up clothes who has never been out of his home town .  even connery , one of the greatest living actors , doesn't have much of a presence outside of a few fiery scenes .  the action scenes are difficult to follow .  director jeremiah chechik ( responsible for the atrocious remake of " diabolique " ) somehow manages to put the camera exactly where it shouldn't be .  things happen , people move around , but even if , with the utmost effort , you were able to care about any of it , the scenes are bewildering .  the primary allure of the original was the interaction between the two leads .  witty banter and an underplayed sexual tension were a winning combination .  admittedly there are a few humorous sexual puns in the film , but there's no chemistry and the repartee is anything but clever .  one of emma peel's first lines of dialog is " rules are made to be broken . "  it doesn't get any better .  advance word alone should have been enough to scare off anyone .  the release date was changed several times .  connery refuses to promote the film .  there was no screening for critics which may have been a good choice for warner brothers .  at least this way , they get something of an audience for the first weekend before the news gets out .  admittedly i haven't seen an episode of the television series for a couple of decades .  my guess is that it would be severely dated now .  no matter how antiquated it might be , there's no doubt that it holds up better than this film is at first viewing .  there's no reason to waste any part of the last few days of summer inside watching this movie .  no reason at all .  
it's probably inevitable that the popular virtual reality genre ( " the matrix , " " existenz " ) would collide with the even more popular serial-killer genre ( " kiss the girls , " " se7en " ) .  the result should have been more interesting than " the cell . "  as the movie opens , therapist catharine deane ( jennifer lopez ) treats a catatonic boy ( colton james ) by entering his mind through some sort of virtual reality technique that's never fully explained .  after months of therapy sessions in a surreal desert , catharine has no success to report .  meanwhile , killer carl stargher ( vincent d'onofrio ) has claimed another victim .  his particular hobby is to kidnap young women , keep them in a glass cell overnight , and drown them .  he takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach , then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching a video tape of the drowning .  although carl's been doing this for awhile , he's recently become sloppy , and fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) is closing in fast .  not fast enough , though , to keep carl from sticking another woman ( tara subkoff ) in the cell or to catch him before he suffers a schizophrenic attack that leaves him in a coma .  from the videos in carl's house , peter can see that the drowning cell is automated and will fill with water forty hours after the abduction .  to save the kidnapped girl , peter has to find the cell before the end of the day , and comatose carl's not talking .  so off they go to catharine in the hope that she can go inside carl's mind and find out where the cell is in time .  the focus of " the cell " in on the ornate interior of carl's mind , but the universe director tarsem singh creates seems more an exercise in computer-generated spectacle than an exploration of the psychotic personality .  for the most part , it's style without substance .  in his own mind , carl is a decadent emperor in flowing robes , ming the merciless , as well as a frightened boy ( jake thomas ) abused by his father .  all in all , the mind of a psycho killer turns out to be a strangely dull place , and i kept wishing i could fast-forward to the next development .  singh is best known for directing music videos , particularly rem's " losing my religion , " and " the cell " seems very much like a really long , really slow mtv video with the sound deleted .  singer lopez seems to think she's in a video as well ; she devotes more time to posing in elaborate costumes than she does to acting .  the premise had great promise .  the computer-generated world within carl's mind could have been a bizarre , surreal universe governed by insanity and symbolism rather than logic .  the first room catharine enters in carl's head shows this promise .  she finds a horse standing in center of the room ; suddenly , sheets of sharp-edged glass fall into the horse , dividing it into segments .  the panes of glass separate , pulling apart the pieces of the still-living horse .  this scene is twisted , disturbing , and thought-provoking , because the psychological importance of the horse and its fate is left to the viewer to ponder .  another element that should have been developed is the effect on catharine of merging with the mind of a psychopath .  their minds begin to bleed together at one point in the movie , and this should have provided an opportunity to discover the dark corners of catharine's own psyche .  like sidney lumet's " the offence " or michael mann's " manhunter , " " the cell " could have explored how the madness of the killer brings out a repressed darkness in the investigator .  however , catharine's character is hardly developed at all , and lopez has no depth to offer the role .  bottom line : don't get trapped in this one .  
i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard .  the problem is , i can't remember them as i write this review .  that's not a good sign .  in booty call , jamie foxx is bunz , a character whom i can't really describe , because i don't know that much about him .  i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk , and that he doesn't like relationships , just " booty calls " at three in the morning ( no questions , no commitment ) .  bunz has a best friend named rushon ( tommy davidson ) , who seems to be bunz's direct opposite : on the straight and narrow , and currently in a long-term commitment ( a whole seven weeks , wow ! ) .  rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend , nikki ( tamala jones ) , but for a reason which is not totally explained , it's going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikki's friend lysterine ( vivica a . fox ) , who have never met .  to make a long story short , the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikki's obsession with safe sex .  first she wants condoms , so bunz and rushon go out and get them .  oh , no , they have to be latex , not lambskin .  back to the store .  now they've got to get dental dams , or there'll be no foreplay .  why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand ?  nikki phones lysterine , who lives across the hall , and tells her she'd better be making these demands , too .  talk about coitus interruptus .  booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those over-the-top comedies .  the difference between the two is that in the latter , things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality .  in this category , for example , you have ace ventura : private eye on the mild side , and airplane !  at the extreme .  there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status , but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention .  it is disappointing , and even worse , distracting .  there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker ( are those real names ? )  does not live up to its potential , as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing .  for instance , there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant .  bunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese , much to everyone's surprise .  however , when asked how he learned the language , he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from late-night kung-fu films , and soon gained mastery .  this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene .  if , on the other hand , when asked how he learned to speak chinese , bunz simply replied with , " kung-fu movies , " and then moved on , the joke would have been much more effective .  this is because it would have been totally unbelievable , but funny because we know it is unbelievable .  by explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible , the film is not giving its viewers enough credit .  the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions .  why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends ?  why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine ?  if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex , why doesn't she have some condoms at her own apartment ?  these questions are not answered by the screenplay , but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward .  a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language .  some movies use a lot of swear words , but use them under very justifiable circumstances , as when they are employed consistent with a character's pattern of speech .  other films , such as the recent jackie brown , use them in ways that almost parody themselves .  booty call just sticks them in to get laughs , and it doesn't work .  they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them .  half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason .  the chinese restaurant , a holdup at a convenience store , and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story , and are in there for filler .  this is surprising , considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long .  it's too bad that the core of the film isn't much better , since it is comprised of sometimes funny , but forgettable dialog .  i refer you to the first paragraph of this review .  
the ads make " hanging up " seem like an upbeat comedy about a rascally father and his three daughters .  anyone who went to the movie expecting that left disappointed .  all of the movie's funny scenes were included in the ad .  so what do we get ?  eve marks ( meg ryan ) just put her father lou mozell ( walter matthau ) into a hospital .  once upon a time , lou was a hollywood screenwriter who collaborated with his now-estranged wife .  his one great moment in life was writing a film for john wayne , who gave him a giant bullet-shaped trophy .  now lou is senile and deteriorating rapidly .  eve tries to convince her sisters georgia ( diane keaton ) and maddy ( lisa kudrow ) that their father is dying and needs them .  both are slow to show concern .  so devoted eve stands vigil over her father , who constantly asks for his favorite daughter georgia , while running her own business ( planning special events ) and caring for her son ( jesse james ) .   ( some comic relief comes when maddy also drops off her ailing st . bernard for eve to care for . )  the tension builds until all three sisters are finally in one room at one of eve's events where georgia is the keynote speaker .  there's a superficial resemblance to shakespeare's " king lear " ( senile king with three daughters : one devoted saint and two selfish bitches ) , but the material is apparently drawn from life .  sister screenwriters delia and nora ephron had parents who were a successful hollywood writing team .  henry and phoebe ephron collaborated on 17 screenplays , including " desk set " and " there's no business like show business . "   ( delia's novel , the basis for the film , is dedicated to henry ) .  surprisingly , the script is as thin as an anorexic's wet dream .  the virtue of a semi-autobiographical project would seem to be the wealth of material available .  yet , the ephrons provide only the barest minimum of information about their characters .  also , the spaces they inhabit seem artificial .  eve lives in a house that looks like a magazine layout ; no matter how put-upon she is , we can't feel sorry for anyone whose house is so pristine on any given day .  georgia is a famous magazine editor , and in her brief scenes while she chats on a cell phone with eve seem like the photo spread for a profile .  when we first meet maddy , she's fishing at a picturesque mountain stream .  i expected to see the credit " cinematography by 'vanity fair . ' "  and , yes , diane keaton is literally old enough to be lisa kudrow's mother .  to her credit , though , she looks young enough to pull it off .  the one redeeming aspect of " hanging up " is that , at its core , is a truth about siblings .  there's always one on which everyone else in the family relies , freeing the others to be selfish and emotionally distant .  my wife is the reliable child in her family ; for better or worse , my brother has the role in mine .   ( being selfish and emotionally distant may not be fulfilling , but it is a lot less work ) .  if you have nothing better to do than watch this movie , look for a powerful cameo by cloris leachman as the sisters' mother pat .  in a devastating scene , eve discovers that her mother doesn't love her .  although leachman is best known for comedies like " young frankenstein " and " the mary tyler moore show , " her performance here reminded me of the considerable dramatic talent she displayed in " the last picture show . "  bottom line : everyone involved has lived in hollywood so long they don't recognize real life anymore .  
_dirty_work_ has a premise of deliciously mean-spirited potential .  mitch weaver ( norm macdonald ) and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna ( artie lange ) are losers in life : they were constantly picked on in school , and now they cannot hold regular jobs .  but as the trailer goes , " there is one thing mitch weaver is good at--revenge . "  so he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in getting-even schemes into a marketable revenge-for-hire business called dirty work inc .  this should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy , but for a film called _dirty_work_ , what ensues is rather clean of spirit .  in fact , what makes mitch and sam start up their business is not a giddy desire to give bullies a taste of their own medicine , but rather a more sappy reason : sam's father ( jack warden ) needs a heart transplant , and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient list , his compulsively betting doctor ( chevy chase ) asks the guys for $50 , 000 to pay off his bookie .  so for all the scheming that goes on , beneath every underhanded plot is--gasp ! --a  heart , which undercuts the inherent nastiness of the premise .  not that there isn't a lot of nastiness on display--there is , but of a different sort .  there are frequent sexual references , most prominently in the form of prostitutes and sam's impotent father's ongoing lust for them .  and for a film rated pg-13 , director bob saget ( yes , that bob saget , of _full_house_ and _america's_funniest_home_videos_ fame ) and writers frank sebastiano , fred wolf , and macdonald himself , stretch the boundaries of good taste rather far--arguably a bit too much so ( was not one , but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary ? ) .  but the issue , of course , is not so much of taste as it is humor--as in , is it funny or not ?  the answer is a resounding no .  it's not that macdonald isn't a funny guy .  he was one of the more consistently funny performers on _saturday_night_live_ before his much-talked-about firing , and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen ; it also doesn't hurt that he's a natural , likable screen presence .  he is able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch , but , for the most part , the oneliners , as written , are flat , and the broad slapstick gags just don't work ( one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildings--a real riot ) .  still , macdonald's few shining moments are just about the only moments the film has .  the late chris farley , as hysterical as he ever was , is amusing in a cameo role , but , as a whole , the supporting players are amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance .  saget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman , adam sandler , and john goodman , but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent _dirty_work_ from sputtering to the end of its brief 81-minute running time .  the film closes on a sad note of desperation , an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement .  come to think of it , i cannot imagine anyone but those involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety of _dirty_work_ .  
certainly no one would rent ed wood's glen or glenda ?  expecting to see a good movie , but this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a level of incompetence that i didn't know was possible .  in fact , wood's infamous plan 9 from outer space actually seems pretty tame by comparison .  watching glen or glenda ?  i found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies and accidentally edited them together ; as a result , it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious .  the movie starts out as what mostly seems like a bad documentary , with endless , repetitive narration about transvestites , how difficult it is for a transvestite to look at his girlfriend's clothes without being able to wear them , how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals , and how the main character , glen/glenda is ( as it reminds us probably half a dozen times ) " not half man and half woman , but man and woman at the same time . "  the camera work is terrible-occasionally the camera lingers on , say , a closed door while the characters talk off-screen , or inexplicably zooms in on someone's ear or nose .  wood also makes copious use of mostly irrelevant stock footage , which leads to voiced-over non-sequiturs like , " yes , our world is a busy and frightening place , with so many people driving their automobiles . "  finally , there is occasional commentary from bela lugosi as a sort of omniscient being who seems to inhabit a frankenstein-style laboratory , delivering pointless lines such as , " people .   .   .  all with their own thoughts .   .   .  their own ideas .   .   .   . "  while lightning crackles quasi-ominously overhead .  had wood continued in this vein , glen or glenda ?  probably would have been remembered as nothing more than a poorly done documentary with the occasional inappropriate horror-movie touch .  unfortunately , he then wanders so far off into left field that you have to wonder if he had been eating some funny mushrooms when he wrote the script .   " pull the string !  pull the string ! "  announces an alarmed lugosi as stock footage of buffalo appears .  there is another crash of lightning before lugosi returns , this time warning us , " beware .   .   .  beware the big green dragon that lurks outside your door !   .   .   .  it eats little boys .   .   .  and puppy dogs' tails .   .   .  and big fat snails ! "  a bizarre nightmare sequence , which is probably meant to be symbolic but instead is just incredibly stupid , ensues , during which glen/glenda finds his fiance trapped under a fallen tree-in the living room .  someone who is apparently intended to be the sinister " green dragon " ( but looks more like a klingon from the original star trek series ) appears to be orchestrating all this , though the film is far from clear on this point ( to put it kindly ) .  near the end of this scene-and here i must confess that wood lost me completely-is a violent sexual encounter on a couch that features two characters who do not even appear in the rest of the movie and is scored by goofily upbeat folk music .  after this scene ends ( not a moment too soon ) , glen or glenda ?  returns to its documentary style , but at that point any lingering sense that wood had the slightest idea what he was doing is pretty much gone .  the film wanders to a dumb happy ending that also seems to abandon much of what it was trying to say about transvestitism , but at that point it didn't matter much what happened .  as soon as the aforementioned sex scene was over , glen or glenda ?  had pretty much cemented its place in my mind as the most incoherent film i had ever seen .  i honestly think that if i picked up my camcorder and deliberately tried to make the worst movie i possibly could , it still might not match glen or glenda ?  for sheer cinematic disaster .  i am giving this movie an f , but i'm not sure that quite does it justice .  
so i went and saw this film right , it was called " battlefield : earth " , i was never interested in the previews , and never too terribly interested in the book , nor do i find scientology interesting , but after reading advanced reviews of how bad this film really is , i had that weird urge just to watch it .  well let me be the first to say , and so far in my view it's safe to say : battlefield : earth might be the worst film i have ever seen , yes even worse than " mr . magoo " , " blue in the face " , or " jaws : the revenge " .  roger christianson whos credits include set direction , and art direction for such great films as " alien " and " star wars " , directs this film with such amateurism , that the film looks and feels and in fact sounds so dumb , that it's quite depressing .  the look of the film , is dark and drabby at times , but then bright and happy at other times .  the sound is terrible , and has the worst surround sound effects i've heard .  the acting is nothing , the dialogue poor , and the make-up effects hideous .  here's the so-called plot : earth 3000 . . . . man is a endangered species , while aliens from the planet psychlo ( the aliens are named psychlo . . . i  wonder why ? ! ) are invading earth , destined to put an end to those " man-animals " to an end , and destroy earth once and for all , of course we have our typical hero ( played terrible by barry pepper , who was great in a small role in 1999's " the green mile " ) who is destined to go out , and save his planet !  one thing : he has to go up against , terl , the chief of security psychlo , who is played frankly , quite bad by john travolta , whom with dreadlocks , a big head , and green eyes just doesn't work .  of course the sidekick to terl , is played by ( lol ! ! )  forest whitaker , who looks like a deformed werewolf of some kind .  our friendly human johnny ( barry pepper ) looks just as bad as well , with long scraggly hair .  i'm not really sure how to quite explain the badness of this film , except just to say it's terrible .  everything in this film is imcomprehinsable , from the make-up effects , which by the way aren't good , to the phony looking special effects , everything in this film is faulted .  in fact i don't remember one part in this entire movie where i was having a good time , or enjoying myself .  in fact there is no part in the movie that i liked or enjoyed .  throughout the entire 127 minute running time , i was dying , constantly looking at my watch , and hoping maybe the projectioner would blow a bulb or something , sadly it didn't .  my advice to hollywood : get new scripts , new acting classes , better directors and damnit , make films like american beauty more .  
billy crystal reappears in yet another high concept comedy .  he tries to infuse some life into it , but it gets bogged down with sentimentality and a lack of sophistication .  sammy ( billy crystal ) is a struggling agent at the end of his ropes .  he's separated from his wife , serena ( kathleen quinlan ) , and down to his last serious client . . . in a low-budget film shooting in romania .  but in a turn of bad luck , sammy wrecks his car . . . only  to be mysteriously saved by a giant ( gheorghe muresan ) .  but this giant has a heart of gold .  he leads a solitary life , helping out the monks at a local monastery .  his only longing is for his long lost love , lilianna ( joanna pacula ) , who has since moved to america .  sammy , seeing a golden ticket , convinces max to become an actor ( represented by sammy , of course ) , and come back to america .  and so sam and max bounce from pathetic job to pathetic job , with sammy dangling a meeting with lilianna as a carrot before max's nose .  but slowly sammy's deceptions begin to haunt him .  but will he develop a conscience before the innocent max becomes disillusioned .  the humor in my giant isn't the world's greatest .  mostly , it falls under the category of " boy . . . he's  so big ! " ,  and that can only go so far , no matter how hard the talent tries .  still , its slightly amusing parts are longed for when the movie gets bogged down in sappy moments .  the film's best moment ( and that's not saying much ) is a bit part by steven seagal , playing himself .  between executive decision and this , all of seagal's best roles have been cameos .  maybe he should consider a change of work : steven seagal , the character actor !  gheorghe muresan isn't a natural actor at all , and his thick cotton-mouthed accent certainly doesn't help .  in fact the only thing he adds to the role is his immense stature .  originally , the concept was designed several years ago for andre the giant .  andre also had a hefty accent , but he displayed a knack for comedy in the princess bride . . . something  muresan should have studied for some pointers .  why does billy crystal continually get caught in these pathetic comedies ?  he's proven that he can be much funnier than these formulaic films allow him to be , and yet , like a glutton for punishment , he keeps coming back .  that doesn't mean we have to .  
synopsis : melissa , a mentally-disturbed woman who likes to smoke , seduces doug , a minor-league baseball player who likes to study anatomy , work on motorcycles , and make out with his girlfriend in a public library .  when doug decides to stop seeing her , melissa maliciously takes revenge on those around him , including his girlfriend , his mother , and his cat .  comments : malicious , i suppose , is an acceptable moview for what it is : a cheap , b-movie thriller which rips off dozens and dozens of spurned-psycho-lover-who-wants-revenge films ( like fatal attraction , hand that rocks the cradle , etc . etc . ) that have come before it .  malicious , however , really doesn't provide very many particularly suspenseful moments .  the plot starts off energetically enough , the main characters are introduced and the affair between doug and melissa begins and ends pretty early on in the film .  it starts to drag , unfortunately , after this .  melissa will obviously try to take her revenge on doug ( as always seems to happen in movies like these ) , but she does so in unimaginative ways that have been done in other , better thrillers before .  she drugs someone .  she kills a family pet and leaves it in the girlfriend's apartment .  and , of course , she stalks , so we see a number of shots , which are supposed to be suspenseful , where she's spying on doug and his girlfriend .  i won't reveal the ludicrous ending to this turkey , but i warn you that it's both painfully obvious and a real yawner .  john vernon does a remarkably good job at playing the not-so-bright baseball jock who initially gets swept away by melissa ( one of the script's faults is to try to pass off a character like this as a pre-med student ) .  the same cannot be said , though , for molly ringwald .  at times , she can effectively pull off the obsessed lover routine , especially during her silent , i'm-going-to-stare-you-down scenes .  at other times , however , she just seems somehow goofy and out of place .  in one particular scene which i guess was supposed to be suspenseful , she screeches " f--k you , you b-----d " and throws a phone .  she delivers the line so ridiculously that one can't help but laugh .  malicious certainly isn't the worst thriller of its kind out in the video racks ( a number of really fat turkies in this genre are out there ) , but it isn't all that good or original either .  feel free to treat this film maliciously , watch something else .  
here's something to chew on : what's the favorite food of big , cheesy-looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising ?  the obvious answer to this question is cardboard , because that's the depth of the most fully- developed character in this painfully generic creature feature .  deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer .  in fact , considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas , perhaps it was .  the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore .  not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh ( both human and non-human ) been scattered in all directions .  we learn some bloody trivia , as well , such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red ( it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains ) and what it does with half-digested leftovers .  i suppose deep rising's gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre , but it doesn't do much for me .  on the surface , and that's about the only level at which this film can be analyzed , deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic ( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens/titanic connection , since james cameron directed both ) .  in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue-in-cheek mayhem of tremors , deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin .  the film is not humorous , tense , or exciting .  in fact , it's downright boring , and , despite being half the length of cameron's current box-office champ , deep rising feels like the longer movie .  is it really necessary to say anything about the plot ?  probably not , since it's easy to guess , but i'll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis .  the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship .  in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics , there's finnegan ( treat williams ) , the boat's pilot , who's supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff ; joey ( kevin j . o'connor ) , the inept sidekick who's supposed to be lovable and funny ( but is really just irritating ) ; and hanover ( wes studi ) , the " mastermind " ( and i use that term lightly ) of the operation .  their goal : attack a cruise ship , clean out the safe , then sink it using some illegally-acquired torpedoes .  the problem is , by the time they reach the argonautica , the titanic-like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste .  aside from a beautiful jewel thief ( famke janssen ) and a couple of crew members , there's no one on board .  the reason soon becomes obvious -- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles .  the cast , which is led by treat williams , is primarily comprised of has-beens and probably-never-will-bes ( two exceptions : wes studi , best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans , and djimon hounsou , amistad's cinque ) .  williams , once a " can't miss " prospect in hollywood , has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising , and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career .  famke janssen , who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye , is the perfect bland match for williams .  given her limited acting abilities , it's likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes .  unfortunately , a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee-shirt for half of the picture .  meanwhile , kevin j . o'connor , who has entirely too much screen time , exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard .  these days , audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer-generated special effects .  this is a lesson that writer/director stephen sommers ( who previously helmed the live-action jungle book ) needs to learn .  the days of jurassic park , when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen , are past .  now , movie-goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic -- visuals that are so well-incorporated that it's impossible to tell where they end and where " reality " begins .  in deep rising , the monster , like everything , is artificial and unconvincing .  unfortunately , the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isn't so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture , but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre ( although , to be fair , deep rising is a particularly bad entry ) .  even once this film has sunk out of sight , the knowledgeable viewer knows it won't be the last of its kind .  like the slimy , slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies , more are waiting just around the corner in ambush .  and that consideration , unlike anything on screen , is truly horrifying .  
seen december 2 , 1997 at 6 : 50 p . m . at the glenwood movieplex cinemas ( oneida , ny ) , theater #3 , by myself for free ( free pass ) .  [theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture]  there are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons .  they provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context , from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation .  watching " flubber " really clinched this idea for me , because it's just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy .  it proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality , and how important it is to actually have a story .  the film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted , cartoony atmosphere .  we meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard ( williams ) , the typical , supposedly likable mad scientist .  within the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is .  phillip's memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemer's disease - isn't this rather lowbrow comedy ?  he starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class ( an inappropriate joke for a kids' movie if i ever saw one ) .  we learn he has stood his up fiancee , sara ( harden ) , twice at the altar simply because he's forgotten .  sara claims to love him , but says if he forgets the wedding again she'll stop loving him ( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has ) .  but even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve , and it's no surprise the major conflicts here are related .  christopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft , a scientist who not only wants to steal phillip's ideas , but his woman too .  what's worse is that sara actually seems interested in him !  wilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield , which is going broke , unless phillip can invent something to save the day .  one of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film .  the flubber is played for gags after it is introduced , but is all but forgotten about thereafter .  it's obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber , a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy , and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny .  unfortunately , the flubber , like all the special effects in this film , looks very fake and unconvincing .  flubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality , and by the time it performs a song and dance routine , you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object .  most of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy ( since phillip's absent-mindedness is forgotten about ) and somehow push the story along .  but it's clear how weak this premise is from the get-go and the film just gets worse .  all the jokes involve people getting hit by fast-moving , flubber-powered objects including : bowling balls ; flying cars that don't fly well ; and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air .  it's all presented with complete logic , and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes .  during the basketball scene , the coach for the rival team actually says , " i think they might be cheating , " to which the referee replies , " there's no rules about jumping too high . "   " predictable " doesn't begin to describe the motions the film goes through , especially after the halfway point .  and it's not how terribly contrived the plot is , it's the way it's broken down scene-by-scene , with absolutely no transition .  not only that , but all the actors here , especially williams , seem bored to tears .  i'd say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen , so it's almost forgivable when you realize they're talking to nothing and interacting with nothing .  it's safe to say everything that could be bad about " flubber " is .  the only original element the film has is the world's first romance between a machine and a human .  but this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it , and , like the rest of the film , you won't .  
salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets .  actors who demand such salaries might be greedy , but in some instances they are quite justified , because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation .  proof for that can be found even in the realm of low-budget movies , and one fine example is breakaway , 1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring ( in ) famous figure skater tonya harding .  face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movie's poster , but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra , attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster .  one day she decides to retire , but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that .  realising that her life suddenly became worthless , myra starts running for her life , followed by professional assassins .  terri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater .  although tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities , her acting leaves much to be desired .  on the other hand , her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality , believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave b-films a bad name .  martin sheen's brother joe estevez , whose character looks like he had entered from another movies' set , is the only bright spot of breakaway .  unfortunately , he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya harding's silver screen debut proved to be her last film .  
there ? s nothing quite like a gory anime .  really , and this is the truth , no other genre in film gets away with such violence without a word being said in the media about it .  with anime , a common shot is watching a body getting quickly cut in two , and the rest of the insides falling out seconds afterword .  this is a standard practice in anime , or at least the half dozen or so titles that i ? ve seen .  vampire hunter d is a gory , gory film .  if they ever made a live version of the film , it would be banned in several countries and given a rating somewhere below xxx .  it ? s not that it ? s gore is unique - it ? s just like other gory animes - but this one was supposed to stand out because of the complexity it ? s story , characters , animation , etc . . .  it really didn ? t .  it was disgusting and gruesome , which overshadowed the story , what little of it there was .  it seems that in the not too distant future vampires and evil control the world , because god knows that our local police force just can ? t seem to get a handle on vampires in the movies .  one evening , a blond peasant girl , drawn to look 17 and innocent ( a foreshadow that we will see her naked , i guessed early on it would be in the shower or in a rape scene ) is out fighting evil in her local forest preserve when she stumbles onto the private property of a ten thousand year old vampire ( insert strom thurmand joke here . )  of course , he never put a ? no trespassing ? sign on his yard , so one can ? t really blame her , but he ? s upset anyway and demands retribution .  she gets the obligatory bite on the neck ( aren ? t there other places to get blood from ?  it seems like a bite in the elbow would do well enough .  if it's good enough for doctors to draw blood from , then why do vampires stray from that sight ? )  to fight the spell , she enlists the help of a mysteriously tall , dark and handsome vampire hunter ( you guessed it , his name is d ) .  the vampire hunter is torn between fighting vampires , being attracted to the 17 year old peasant girl and finding reasons not to talk too much .  you see , like all heroes in these kinds of stories , he ? s a brooder , who ? s sole purpose in life is to remain really , really silent .  when he speaks , it ? s in cliches .  heroes like this are bad when they ? re live , even worse when animated .  later the vampire hunter storms the castle to meet the big bad vampire , who wants to marry the peasant girl because he ? s bored after 10 , 000 years of living ( the only clever vampire insight made in the movie ) , will vampire hunter d rush to save her in time ?  will we see blood and intestines spattering on every place imaginable ?  in it ? s defense , the animation , when focusing on being original rather than recycling anime slicing , could at times be original .  the talking hand was clever - and i think the inspiration for a skateboard-related logo .  and that ? s the best defense i can think of .  i understand that vampire hunter d is supposed to be a fave among anime fans , but i really don ? t see it .  it ? s an excuse to watch blood dripping from teeth , blood exploding out of eye sockets and horses necks , and most importantly , like all violent anime , it is an excuse to see animated breasts .  why ?  what is the point of that ?  maybe i have to understand the genre and look past the obsessive gore and mysogny .  i ? m not a prude , i just don ? t think it ? s warranted .  it puts itself so far out in front of the movie that everything else gets lost .  is there a neccesity in seeing a 17 year old in the shower ?  of course not ? it ? s done for shock .  it ? s tasteless and despicable .  
at the end of an action scene in " lara croft : tomb raider , " a wall collapses near the nubile warrior .  with her face on the floor , she gazes into the rubble , then grins abruptly and says " oh , my car keys ! "  i mention this scene because it was the only moment in the whole damned production that made me smile .  based on an incredibly popular video game , " lara croft : tomb raider " is a lousy movie .  the structure goes like this : poorly-staged action sequence , boring exposition , poorly-staged action sequence , boring exposition , etc . etc . , the end .  basically , the film exists to showcase angelina jolie's puffy lips and enhanced tits .  close-ups are framed oh-so-carefully to include her million dollar bazooms .  running scenes highlight her bouncing breasts in vintage " baywatch " fashion .  there's even include a shower scene that offers a brief side view of them .  but the filmmakers are so inept they can't even flash the audience correctly .  the one extended display of nudity is of - get ready for this - a guy .  for no particular reason , a muscular supporting character strolls around naked for about 30 seconds , with each shot composed to barely cover his package , ? la " austin powers . "  now , i enjoy a good looking male body as much as the next gay guy , but what the hell is beefcake doing in a t&a flick aimed at heterosexual males ?  of course , what else should one expect in a film that does virtually nothing right ?   " tomb raider " sets up elaborate action set pieces , then renders them incomprehensible with needless jump cut editing ( a promising dual bungee cord battle is ruined by excessive cuts ) .  it promises a series of exotic locales , then delivers cavernous sets and grimy matte paintings with smoggy skies .  throw in some bargain basement computer graphics and you end up with the ugliest movie to come down the pike in many moons .  intended to be a rousing " indiana jones " style adventure , " tomb raider " lacks any sense of tension .  the low point comes when lara is " threatened " by statues of monkey warriors and a giant multi-armed shiva figure that come to life courtesy of cgi .  easily the lamest menaces i have ever seen , the creatures move like snails and fall apart with a single shot from a gun .  if you ever have to be chased by monsters , pray that you get the monkey warriors .   " tomb raider " tells a story , sort of .  once every 5 , 000 years , the planets align .  a group of very bad men are out to find two halves of an object that , if reassembled just as the planets align , will give them control over time itself .  lara's goal is to stop them and rescue her long-missing poppa ( jon voight , jolie's real life dad ) .  none of this matters though , because stunning gaps in internal logic assure that the plot of " lara croft : tomb raider " is as lame as ever other aspect of the film ? except angelina jolie's lips and breasts .  
 " america's sweethearts " has an intriguing premise and a great cast , but it isn't nearly as edgy or funny as it should be .  almost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co-script writer billy crystal , who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co-hosting " comic relief " charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg ( two other paragons of self-indulgence ) .  crystal ignores a simple , but crucial , rule : for a screwball comedy to work , the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting , because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous .   " america's sweethearts " takes place at a press junket , where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters .  it's a promising set-up , but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules , thus dissipating the tension of the situation .  by the end of the film , all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on , but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed .  john cusack and catherine zeta-jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison , a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector ( hank azaria ) , a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp .  of the last nine films eddie and gwen made together , six crossed the $100 million mark , but the prospects for their final effort , a space opus titled " time over time , " are far from rosy .  while eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup , gwen's solo films have tanked .  to make matter worse , the director of the movie ( christopher walken ) , a " visionary " who purchased the unabomber's cabin and had it moved to his backyard , is withholding the film from the studio , insisting that the first screening be held at the junket .  desperate to win over the press , the studio elects to hire lee ( billy crystal ) , a recently fired publicist , to salvage the situation .  lee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation .  he enlists the help of kiki ( julia roberts ) , gwen's sister , personal assistant and whipping girl .  what lee doesn't know is that kiki is in love with eddie , a fact that could temper her effectiveness .  press junkets are a haven for control freaks .  studios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel , with food and drink always at hand .  generally , on the evening of their arrival , writers are bussed to see the featured film , then ferreted straight back to the hotel .  the next day , writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews .  every 30 minutes or so , a producer , director , writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions , with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things .  the atmosphere is one of cordial oppression ? writers are free to ask what they want , but understand that if the studio dislikes a question , they may not be invited to future junkets .  representatives from tv stations face even more restrictions .  they get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew , with the studio filming the exchanges .  the " reporters " are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars , but to play it safe , the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs .  placing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired , but the screenplay undermines the conceit .  the junket is moved from the handsome , but highly confining , four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas .  for most of the film , the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds , completely safe from the eyes of the press .  when they do deal with journalists , the " it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters " premise is de-clawed .  gwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll , they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and , at the screening of the movie , everyone connected with the film goes nuts , all without any repercussions .  lee certainly isn't bothered by any of the infantile outbursts ; in fact , he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids .  is the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors ?  hell no ? they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie .  all of which underscores how billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise : the comedy in " america's sweethearts " is based on barely-in-control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters , except that it doesn't matter because any publicity is good publicity .  and thus the very set-up for the film implodes , leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter .  so what about the cast ?  julia roberts , at her best playing the underdog , is utterly charming here , although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit ( and not a very convincing one , by the way ) .  catherine zeta-jones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic .  by casting himself as the publicist , billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on " comic relief " - stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks .  in supporting roles , hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed " too broad . "  seth green is amusing as a toadie , stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair , though he has little to work with .  come to think of it , " little to work with " is the operative phrase for this movie .  as a hollywood satire , " america's sweethearts " is toothless .  as a romance , it is at best a minor pleasure .  such a good cast , such a waste of their efforts .  had it not been taken long ago , a better title for the film would have been " much ado about nothing . "  
the crown jewel of 1970's irwin allen disaster movies , the poseidon adventure features an all-star cast including gene hackman and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a cruise ship .  the story begins on the u . s . s .  poseidon's big new year's cruise , where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the only passengers left alive .  let's see , there's the new age preacher ( hackman ) who advises people to " pray to that part of god within yourself . "  there's the ex-cop ( borgnine ) who busted a hooker ( stella stevens ) six times -- then married her .  there's the hippie singer ( " there's got to be a morning after . . . " ) who turns to the company of a lonely man ( red buttons ) once her brother is killed .  and to round out the group : the elderly couple ( jack albertson and shelley winters ) who live aboard the ship , the beautiful teenage girl and her brother who are sailing alone and adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall .  we get to know these people a little too well in the first thirty minutes of the poseidon adventure , before straight- faced ship captain leslie nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship .  everyone's in the giant ballroom at the time , shortly past midnight of the new year , when the ship turns first on its side , then completely upside down .  the second- in-command wants everyone to wait in the ballroom until help arrives , but rebel hackman leads his small band of followers on a quest to the top of the ship .  in this case , because the ship is overturned , the top is the bottom .  or is the bottom the top ?  either way , we get to see a lot of bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders and -- in the ballroom scene -- christmas trees .  thus begins an hour or more of hushed trips down long corridors , through burning rooms , etc . while the ship slowly fills with water behind them .  it's a race against the clock which is only mildly interesting .  the poseidon adventure works more as a bad movie to laugh at , with all the melodrama that comes in-between the non-thrilling action scenes .  the one note in borgnine's one-note performance is to be a cranky old man that argues with hackman every step of the way while buttons and the hippie fall in love ( although since there isn't a sex scene , we never find out if his buttons really are red ) and albertson and winters wonder if they'll live to see their grandson's birth .  shelley winters provides the most hilarious scene in the movie in a scene toward the end , where water has flooded the next two rooms of the ship and hackman is preparing to dive under with a rope for the rest of them to pull along .  winters , who has been the whiny fat woman throughout the movie ( stevens even not-so- affectionately calls her " fatass " in one scene ) , finally finds her purpose .   " i was the underwater swimming champ of new york three years running when i was seventeen , " she brags , and before hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen for three years , she's swimming through the water , her skirt billowing up around her hips , showing off her cellulite ( or do you call it shellulite ? )  ridden thighs .  it's not so much funny as innately disgusting , which pretty much sums up the poseidon adventure as a whole .  
in the mid-1980s , following the splendid debut in hugh hudson's greystoke and relative success of first highlander film , it looked like christopher lambert's acting career might go somewhere .  but , it wasn't meant to be , which became obvious following highlander ii .  in this decade christopher lambert became associated with films with low budgets and even lower quality .  very often such films were science fiction , which meant that the fans of that genre learned the hard way what to evade anything starring christopher lambert .  whether it was because of real lack of talent , terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isn't important - the end result was almost always horrible .  the same can be said for fortress , 1993 science fiction film directed by stuart gordon , director who created cult following with his 1980s horror gorefests like reanimator and from beyond .  the movie is set in 2018 .  for some undisclosed reason , usa introduced strict population control and couples are barred from having more than one child .  jake ( christopher lambert ) and karen brennick ( lori laughlin ) broke that law and are caught by authorities on the border .  sentenced to 31 years in prison , they are both thrown into fortress , privately owned correctional facility , equiped with state-of-the-art futuristic technology and run by computer called zed .  although equiped with gismos that regulate every aspect of inmates' lives and make any escape impossible , prison authorities often use violence .  jake survives many ordeals and earns respect of some inmates which would help him when he begins planing the escape .  such escape should become necessity , because the warden poe ( kurtwood smith ) begins showing unhealthy interest in karen .  after rather intriguing beginning and some interesting special effects that depict the futuristic settings of prison , this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity .  the reason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates into whole series of prison movie clich ? s and situations that are painfully predictable .  by the time brennick begins his escape from fortress , those situations not only begin to look predictable , but utterly implausible too .  of course , film never tried to explain why the country that lacks resources to support its present population happens to spend bucketloads of money on ultra-expensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous members of the society .  the initially interesting plot is done even more wrong by stereotyped characters , played by not too interested or talented actors .  lori laughlin , although physically attractive , shows the acting ability of sequoia .  kurtwood smith as prison warden is rather uninspired , capable of solid , yet forgettable performance .  lambert's performance is also good , but even the bigger talent couldn't help this film , destined to end in oblivion .  
absolute power , the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood , attempts to be a thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff .  it is about as thrilling as a lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper .  one can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interested eastwood .  not only is the plot unbelievable and contrived , but even the writing itself lacks any consistency or intelligence .  continually underestimating the audience , the film gives us information we already know or dont even need .  details essential to the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying ( like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two night-vision goggles in their car ? ) .  oddly enough , the initial setup for absolute power offers interesting possibilities .  a masterful jewel-thief ( played by clint eastwood ) witnesses the murder of the wife of a powerful millionaire ( played by e . g .  marshall ) .  while robbing one of marshalls mansions , he is forced to hide in the bedrooms vault .  there , through a two-way mirror , he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay .  their game of love quickly turns into a violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman .  in self defense , the woman grabs a letter-opener and stabs the man in the elbow .  she raises her arm to stab again when she is fatally shot by two secret service men .  the man ?  he is the president of the united states of america .  where does the film go wrong ?  it cannot be the acting .  clint eastwood , ed harris and gene hackman as the president give type-cast , but decent performances .  the cinematography is sufficient ; wild and erratic during action sequences , dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes , and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue .  even the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the thriller/suspense genre .  the fault clearly lies in the screenplay , and the screenplay alone .  while setting up a story about misuse of power , about the true possessors of that power , and about intrigue and double-crossing , it does not resolve it .  not one buildup of suspense is resolved by an exciting climax .  rather , the tense situations are left dangling at the end , giving the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness .  an example of this is a very promising and tense buildup of a scene : in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood , the police have set up a trap at a small restaurant .  police officers are everywhere , incognito of course .  at the same time , not one but two hit men are preparing to kill clint eastwood when he arrives .  all three parties are unaware of each others presence .  this scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is wondering how clint eastwood , who might suspect this is a trap , will get himself out of this difficult position .  he will probably have a brilliant plan , involving ingenious preparations .  however , when he arrives at the trap , both hit men miss ( how convenient ) and in the confusion eastwood simply walks away .  the buildup of this scene took about ten minutes .  ten minutes of close ups of the hit men loading their weapons intercut with the police preparing for the trap .  the scene was resolved in less than 20 seconds . . .  parallel to the story line of catching the real killer is a cliche emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father eastwood and his daughter .  the daughter blames her father for never being there for her , because he was either in jail or robbing a house somewhere .  of course their relationship takes a turn for the better during the adventure and they end up a happy family .  again , it is commendable that absolute power tries to deviate from the mainstream suspense film by giving room for a dramatic subplot .  however , trying is simply not enough !  the second story line should be subtle , original and preferably unpredictable . . .  everything this film is not .  how could a screenplay like absolute power ever get the funding to be produced ?  how could eastwood , who has successfully produced and directed many outstanding films such as the brilliant unforgiven , ever believe in a project like this one ?  i am sad to say that my respect for the actor/director/producer has diminished substantially due to this film .  director quentin tarantino once said : " i can make a good movie out of any bad script . "  director clint eastwood obviously cannot .  
 " there's nothing new under the sun " is a phrase often used when the speaker actually means " let's find something to copy . "  of course there are very few completely original ideas .  even earth-shattering concepts are built upon the vast body of human experience .  there is , after all , no need to re-invent the wheel time after time .  recently it seems that hollywood doesn't feel the need to even re-write the script .  my understanding of the word " sequel " is a continuation of the story .  the film industry has defined the word to mean reshooting the original with minor changes .  have an overwhelming desire to see an inferior version of brian depalma's adaptation of the steven king novel ?  this is your dream come true .  rachel ( emily bergl ) , a high school outcast , is beginning to notice weird things happening around her .  doors slam shut by themselves .  glass globes blow up .  her mother has severe mental problems and her father is absent .  a popular boy unexpectedly asks her out .  the in-crowd conspires to embarrass her at a public event .  any of this sound familiar ?  once the audience catches on that this is the same story as " carrie " , there's little to do but wait for the inevitable ending .  the effects are a bit better this time around , but the film doesn't work nearly as well .  there are a couple of minor plot differences .  rachel lives with foster parents because her mother is institutionalized .  the boys at her school are portrayed as even more evil than in the original .  they keep score of their scoring with points given for each conquest .  and , uh , there must be other story changes but none stand out .  one nice touch is the casting of amy irving again as sue snell .  over 20 years ago she was the one girl who tried to help carrie .  now a high school counselor , she befriends rachel , but her character's potential is squandered .  there's too much about sue that doesn't make sense .  after the slaughter when carrie kills most of her classmates , sue is driven mad and spends time in the institution that rachel's mother is in .  still living in the same small town , the woman with a well-known history of mental problems is hired as a high school counselor ?  sue tells rachel that her telekinesis is a genetic disease .  this may be the one original idea in the film , but the reasoning behind describing psychic powers as a " disease " is never explained .  sue's eventual fate is an admission by director katt shea and writer rafael moreu that they had an interesting character but couldn't figure out what to do with her .  blink and you'll miss it .  some of the events are filmed in black and white , but the rationale for this is unknown .  it doesn't add anything and the choice of scenes appears somewhat random .   " the rage " retains some of the trappings of " carrie " without the meaning .  in the first film the color red was a motif connected to carrie's onset of powers at the same time she began menstruating .  here there's an abundance of red , but for no apparent purpose .  the casting of high school jocks and cheerleaders as villains is beginning to wear thin .  one might be lead to suspect that most filmmakers were unpopular in school and the history of teenage films is an extended cinematic revenge of the nerds .  the biggest mistake the film makes is including clips of the original .  seeing sissy spacek on the screen only points to the quality of that film - and the flaws in this one .  
i should have known , damn it , i should have known .  ewan mcgregor - codename : " eye " - is pointing a high-tech rifle-ly gadget at a fat , bald business-oriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in a window across the street .  we get the requisite electro-green through-the-sight view .  we the audience , seeing a high tech rifle-ly gadget , of course think that eye is going to assassinate the target , but instead , he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy , low-quality photographs , which eye then proceeds to fax and e-mail to everyone in his target's office .  all right , so thirty seconds in , i was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless rifle/camera , but i was still open minded . . .  maybe there's a really good reason for it .  i've got reason to believe , you see - i admire a lot of ewan mcgregor's previous work . . .  and he's obi wan ke- friggin-nobi for god's sake .  and director stephan elliot's last movie priscilla , queen of the desert was a quirky little delight .  there's some genuine talent involved here .  i think at the twenty minute mark , there was still a spark of hope in my heart .  eye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his organization's son ( i still have no idea what this organization was - british intelligence ?  national spy ring ?  private investigation ? ) , who is apparently stealing from his trust fund .  he has received his assignment from k . d .  lang , through an elaborate and expensive teleconferencing briefcase .  when eye tracks his target to an expensive- looking secluded house , he witnesses a mysterious and beautiful woman ( ashley judd ) take a knife out and proceed to stab the poor bastard .  ok , that's odd , i think to myself , this could be interesting .  then she starts to cry , and through her tears exclaims " merry christmas , dad ! "  for the first time .  so begins our tale of obsession . . .  or . . . something .  the rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregor's eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states , totally and completely obsessed by this woman from afar .  throughout his entire professional life , he has been a voyeur ; so when he falls for someone , the only way he can handle it is to watch and drool through telescopes and cameras .  fine , that's a lovely premise , i suppose .  but gosh darn it , if you're going to go there , you better have some sort of explanation .  and that's precisely where this film fails .  this is the kind of movie that pisses me off .  it's an abortion , a collection of half-formed and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing in the end .  it pretends it is something that it is not - a surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in a high-tech thriller .  here , the filmmakers have confused " surreal " and " deep " with " vaguely unclear " and " crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors . "  i never , even for an instant , had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in " love " with this woman who changes wigs and kills people .  the movie offers only two explanations , neither of which make a lick of sense .  explanation number one : the obnoxious presence of eye's imaginary daughter , who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago , tells him he shouldn't leave ms . judd .  explanation two , which by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie : " beauty is in the eye of the beholder . "  whoo hoo , that helps , thanks a bunch , case closed .  that's as deep as it gets , folks .  there is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes , which , instead of tying everything together , ends up being as profound as a clever sixth-grade mad lib .  there are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was .  my personal favorites include : the prison-matron modeled after austin powers' frau farbissina , who apparently taught ms . judd everything she knows about wearing wigs ; jason priestley's awfully played dirty desert vagrant #1 , who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet , but fails miserably ; and the cop-who-sees-ashley-fleeing-an-accident-scene-and- then-wants-to-pay-for-sex- but-is-shot .  each one in this sad little parade is a little more pointless than the last .  the script pays no attention to the laws of time and space .  any time one of the frequent location changes occurs , the camera zooms in on a souvenir snow globe , and minutes , weeks , or years could have passed .  bewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair - one character passes a glass of cognac to another in a slow-motion close-up awash in a lot of bass .  ewan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell .  jason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks , then laughs maniacally . . .  cut to random guy with eye patch . . .  iguana out of focus . . .  iguana comes into focus .  wow , man .  when i found out afterward that this film was based on a novel , it came as no surprise to me .  there are plenty of elements here that , if extended and fleshed out more , would have made for a decent story .  and i wouldn't be surprised if i found out there was an hour and a half of footage cut from this movie lying in a landfill somewhere , or waiting in the wings for the dvd special director's cut . . .  not that anything would ever possess me to purchase such a thing to find out what i was missing .  the last ten or so minutes featured a conversation between the eye and the judd that was supposed to be some sort of revealing exposition .  some guy in the back of the theater was talking on his cell phone , and this time i didn't particularly care all that much because what was happening on the screen was a steaming pile of unholy crap ; the audience around me chuckled and whispered sentiments similar to what i was thinking .  someone near cell-phone-guy did eventually yell , " shut the hell up ! " , but it was a lot funnier when we thought he was talking to the screen .  
i have nothing against unabashedly romantic films .  when done right , with at least slightly evident restraint , they can be engaging , sweeping , appealing .  but it's a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle , a hollow , boring romance that should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers ; the ones willing to buy into ephron's whiny views of life and romance .  tom hanks and meg ryan , two of hollywood's most likeable stars play sam baldwin and annie reed , repectively .  baldwin's wife recently died and he moved to seattle with his son , jonah , seeking to get away from the familiar surroundings which remind him of his late spouse .  jonah senses tension and calls a talk radio show to tell the world about their problems .  sam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show , but when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out .  ephron has him do this so that annie reed ( meg ryan ) can hear it .  annie is a happy woman .  she is engaged to walter , an allergy-prone working man and seems to be perfectly content .  but after hearing sam the widower on the radio show , she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is willing to risk her engagement for it .  five years after this movie hit theaters , hanks , ryan and ephron would team up again in the far better , although still sub-par romantic comedy you've got mail , which is about people who hate each other in real life falling in love on the internet .  at least that movie had a sense of spontaneity .  here it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely to set up for the last five .  the fact that sam and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory .  sleepless in seattle is full of wonderful performers ; from its two leads to supporting stars like bill pullman and rosie o'donnell .  but none of them can save the film from being a bore .  its characters are dull and empty , its script isn't funny or particularly charming .  the script has a fundamental problem : annie gives up , for little reason , her life with walter to pursue " sleepless in seattle , " whom she has never even seen .  it's the kind of life decision that real people don't make , and its a major , unforgivable plausibility sacrifice .  in essence , this movie's purpose is to head towards a goal that shouldn't even exist .  it's a ten minute short film with ninety-five minutes of filler .  if you were to show me sleepless in seattle and i didn't have to review it , you could just call me " asleep in philadelphia .

a cop with a troubled personal life .  a ruthless villain .  a friend of the cop .  a _dead_ friend of the cop .  a quest for vengeance .  a new partner .  a romantic interest .  a chase scene .  a chase scene _in san francisco_ .  a woman in peril .  a confrontation .  an explosion .  the end .  yawn .  yawn .  yawn .  the preceding has been the plot of approximately twelve thousand and six action films ; this one just happens to be called metro .  i have learned to expect little from films like metro , and consequently i am bored by them more often than i am genuinely disappointed .  with eddie murphy on board , however , you hope for something extra , some kind of spark .  when a film makes watching eddie murphy a tedious experience , you know it is doing something terribly wrong .  murphy stars as scott roper , a hostage negotiator for the san francisco police department who is exceedingly good at his job .  with his personal life , he is considerably less successful , facing an unhappy ex-girlfriend named veronica ( carmen ejogo ) , a gambling problem and a mountain of debt .  then his professional life gets a jolt as well when a friend and colleague ( art evans ) is murdered while investigating suspected jewel thief michael korda ( michael wincott ) .  finding korda becomes very personal to scott , and he joins with new partner kevin mccall ( michael rappaport ) to foil korda during an attempted heist .  but all is not well even with korda in jail , as scott , veronica and kevin all continue to face life-threatening danger .  metro ( the title , in case you are wondering , means absolutely nothing ) is so badly put together that even the most casual viewer may notice the miserable pacing and stray plot threads .  in the first place , korda's rage over being discovered before he can make his big score is rendered completely pointless when he proceeds to hit the target anyway ( and , incidentally , to screw it up ) .  a reference to payoffs in the police department , followed by a conspicuous decision to keep scott off the korda case and a couple of pointed glances , is dropped abruptly with no resolution after about forty-five minutes ; even the relationship between scott and new partner kevin is so perfunctory , with kevin disappearing entirely after taking a bullet for scott , that you may yearn for bickering buddies .  worst of all is a plot structure which places the main villain ( the always menacing michael wincott ) behind bars for far too long , leaving a lot of time to kill with the tedious reconciliation of scott and veronica .  you can't blame murphy for being unable to muster any enthusiasm for the scenes with his bland leading lady , but he should have known better than to take this role at all .  scott roper exists in an uncomfortable middle ground between the kind of street-wise fast-talker murphy has built a career on and an actual three-dimensional character , and murphy is never able to reconcile the two .  the script seems to have been doctored for him , with a gambling problem turned into a bit of character color and his supposed inability to form relationships turned into a cause for gags rather than actual conflict , yet there is still too little comedy for murphy to work with .  for much of the film , he walks around with an intense frown , and it is over 90 minutes into metro before you hear that trademark laugh for the first time .  murphy is stranded with too few solid punch lines , and nearly all of the ones he does have bounce of ejogo and fall to the ground limply .  i suppose i should give director thomas carter credit for taking the obligatory san francisco car chase ( how much do you want to bet on the likelihood of seeing a car soar over a hill ? ) and doing a few interesting things with it .  as vehicles are sent flying and passengers sent sprawling by a runaway cable car , it is possible at least for a moment to take some pleasure in a goofy spin on a familiar situation .  carter does an even better job by taking that old suspense stand-by -- the medicine cabinet mirror which will close to reveal a killer standing behind someone -- and using it to defuse tension not once , but _twice_ .  the fact that carter was able to demonstrate even that much recognition of cliches , and a willingness to subvert them , makes his involvement in the rest of the disaster that is metro all the more puzzling .  an action film like this plods so relentlessly and obviously from point a to point b to point c that you might find yourself shouting out " point c ! " while they're still getting to point b , or getting up with the rest of the audience after the big explosion which signals that nothing else of any consequence is going to happen .  
fit for a ghoul's night out , fat girl stands cast iron firm with the simplistic , fatuous , built-in excuse that its woman director is baring the harsh sexual realities of adolescent girls .  being a boy , i might not understand female behavior and am unequipped to analyze this particular pseudo-feminist coming-of-age story .  fair enough .  i'll pretend to ignore the mannered posturing and health class 101 " this is a no-no " dialogue when older teenage boy coaxes younger teenage girl to let him fuck her up the ass , speaking variations on " it won't hurt ! "  for a scene that seems to last at least ten minutes .  this is done almost entirely in an unbroken master shot that suggests unimaginative camerawork more than unblinking voyeurism .  they dare you to look away , without possessing the courage of allowing the children to actually sound like children ( they're mouthpieces for writer-director catherine breillat's one-note clinical politics ) .  rather than show an even-handed evaluation of the rigors of hormonal change , breillat ( previously responsible for the unwatchable romance ) wants to indulge in her hour of hate .  life is pain , highness .  get used to it .  she'd find keen bedfellows in neil labute and todd solondz , other sultans of misanthropy who lack the balls to be earnest or honest .  for children , dealing with trauma and pain is complicated .  to bury that in sarcasm and academic theory feels cheap .  these would-be auteurs ( more like hauteurs ) haven't earned the right to display suffering because they don't layer it in emotional truth ( as mike leigh does throughout naked and david lynch in several key scenes of blue velvet ) .  of course , there i go again comparing her to all these ( better ) male directors .  i don't care .  gender be damned , she's borderline inept .  braced for a knee-jerk reaction from the art house crowd ( mortified shock or compulsory applause will suffice ) , writer-director catherine breillat may well accomplish her mission to get a rise out of people .  don't be fooled .  this grotesque oversimplification of awkward forays into passion may be quickly forgotten , remembered only as cold , boring , philosophically arid , and incompetently photographed .  the hyperviolent climactic sequence proves so extraordinarily misguided that i honestly wondered whether breillat had thrown in an impromptu dream sequence .  twelve years old , a bundle of dough with a sour pout , the superb ana ? s reboux plays the titular fat girl with a thousand yard stare and a frumpy insouciance .   ( her character is also named ana ? s . )  sitting at the table morosely slurping down a banana split , her presence is grounded and heartbreaking .  it's a pity breillat never finds anything for her to do other than get defensive against her evil storybook sister , 15-year old elena ( roxane mesquida ) , for bringing a transitory boyfriend home to their shared room .  in this summer cottage , ana ? s has no escape from her position as stoic bedside observer to elena's depressing confusion of cheap sex with romance .  the boy in question , a smug italian college kid named fernando ( libero de rienzo ) is a real piece of work , claiming that the experience is a declaration of love while begging for a blowjob .  ana ? s doesn't receive any warmth from her largely absent parents , who join elena in making fun of her hefty girth .  she finds pleasure in wandering the beach alone , singing songs to herself , and swimming in the pool kissing the metal railing and pretending that it's her paramour .  reboux commands the screen , but there's only so much a child actress can do recounting pretentious monologues to herself .  if one is inspired to rescue this young performer and place her in a better movie , at least she fares better than the other young talent asked to perform in intense love scenes that might feel justified if they weren't so dramatically misguided .  this 83-minute vignette is something of a horror show , but breillat saves her nastiest poison for the very end .  on the long ride home punctuated by an uncomfortable silence between family members , gigantic trucks swerve by as the hour grows late .  will mommy fall asleep at the wheel ?  perhaps .  or maybe there's something deadlier around the corner , lying in wait to pounce upon the unsuspecting fat girl .  what's more , she might even like it .  with the intent of being unfair and unpredictable , placing her heroine in the most diabolical of corners in order to face up to impending adulthood , breillat's extreme flourish of sadistic tawdriness reveals her as a master purveyor of contempt .  fat girl is a bitter pill indeed .  aka ? ma soeur !  screened at the 2001 new york film festival ( feature coming soon ) .  
the main problem with martin lawrence's pet project , a thin line between love and hate , like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man , is that his character is an irresponsible jerk , and if that is the case , it doesn't seem to do anything except justify the woman's actions .  that is especially the case in lawrence's darnell wright .  he is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long .  now don't think i condone this just because i'm male .  my philosophy is , if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautiful , kind girl , you should treat her like a princess and respect her .  darnell doesn't think like this .  he sleeps with these girls once and dumps them .  and by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target , beautiful , wealthy brandi web ( played nicely by whitfield ) who runs a successful real estate business , is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia ( king ) , i found myself thinking , " i'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy ? "  after all , it is largely darnell's fault .  if he is lining up all these women , you'd think he'd have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day , as his mother says it does .  but he doesn't , so you get the sense that he's not only irresponsible , but also pretty dumb .  you especially get this sense that he's dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her .   ( i'd put my pants on in two seconds after that ! )  now , brandi is a psycho bitch , but it's hard not to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage .  one final flaw , though , is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin with .  brandi is a classy , intelligent woman with an mba from harvard , who initally resists darnell's " immature play " as she calls it , as any woman like her would in real life .  but all of a sudden she says yes .  but when you listen to darnell's four letter word vocabulary watch his actions , you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period , much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him !  lawrence can be good when he wants to , but in order to prove it , he needs to let other people write and direct his movies .  look at this movie .  four writers , as a result it's too long ( two hours , when it could've easily worked at ninety minutes ! ) and it has a lot of subplots and characters that appear and disappear as quickly as they came ( which makes me think the writers didn't get along ) , all of which isn't necessary .  there are some bright spots , though .  whitfield , regina king , della reese , and bobby brown all do what they can with lazily written parts , and they help it out a lot .  and there are some funny parts ( like , for example , the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son and damaging her property ) , but they're just not enough to sustain the film .  
synopsis : valerie , a high school junior who doesn't look a day under 22 , writes bad poetry , complains about how much she hates school , fantasizes about a young guy on trial for raping and murdering six women , chooses him as a pen pal , and plays hooky to see him in court .  after a jailbreak , the killer puts on big sunglasses , wears a half-buttoned jacket , and uses his fatal charm to go after valerie .  comments : " alan smithee " directed fatal charm , which should have been more appropriately titled " fatal bore " or " fatal crap " .  if you find out that a film you're about to see is directed by " alan smithee , " then you should seriously , seriously , seriously consider watching something , anything , else .   " alan smithee " is a pseudonym which a number of directors have used when they produce something really bad .  frankly , i'd be embarrassed if i had directed this turkey , so i think i understand why the director might have picked the " alan smithee " moniker for this film .  where to begin with this painfully poor thriller ?  let's start with the acting .  it's pretty bad .  amanda peterson plays valerie and shows at least some talent ( the rest of the cast don't ) , even though her performance isn't exactly stellar material .  she's also miscast ; she seems way too old to still have a year of high school to complete .  her scenes with valerie's mother , played by mary frann , are a joke .  the two look as though they're a couple of coworkers going out to lunch together , rather than a daughter with her mother who just doesn't understand .  christopher atkins , a handsome enough actor who plays the killer , adam , looks like a clown in the second half of fatal charm .  trying to appear malicious and dangerous , he wears large sunglasses and a half-buttoned jacket .  if disney decided to do a zany comedy caper about the unabomber , atkins would probably be a perfect candidate for the lead , but he doesn't cut it here .  early on in the movie , a number of scenes occurs in a courtroom .  outside of the laughably poor performances given by the actors portraying lawyers , the people sitting in the benches provide the silliest effort at drama in the film .  they constantly shift and turn and arc their heads in mock interest in what has got to be one of the worst perfomances that a large group of people have given at one time ever .  fatal charm's storyline , such as it is , inspires more yawns than thrills .  the script belabors a red herring , early on , about a second suspect who may have committed the murders for which adam ( atkins ) is charged with .  this suspect , however , turns up strangled and drowned halfway through the film : an obvious plot fault .  even for the idiots who didn't consider the movie's title as valerie and a blond newsreporter commented how innocent and charming the defendant seemed , it becomes quite obvious that adam is dangerous when the other suspect washes up .  so , the audience must wait ( if they haven't already stopped watching ) as the necessary details fall into place and the killer goes after the heroine in the drawn-out finale .  the video box for this dud describes fatal charm as an " erotic thriller " .  a thriller it isn't , and neither is it particularly erotic .  i can't imagine , if someone were in the mood for something " erotic , " that he'd be happy after watching this fluff .  a few erotic moments occur in the film ; they take place in a van with little lighting and are filmed out of focus ( see , they're supposed to be valerie's fantasies -- how creative ) .  on a personal note , i was disturbed by the ludicrous english literature class shown in this film which valerie had to suffer through .  it's no wonder why she hated high school so much .  as an instructor of english myself , i have a hard time accepting the fact that in a course emphasizing great literature , a teacher would stoop to reading a student's bad poetry ( of course , it's valerie's ) about boyfriends out loud and then embarassing its author in front of class with questions about the poem's inspiration .  i guess the public school system is still setting dubious standards for its students .  fatal charm won't charm anyone , unless there's someone that's charmed by boring , lifeless , insipid , suspenseless thrillers .  if you happen upon this turkey , just keep moving on .
