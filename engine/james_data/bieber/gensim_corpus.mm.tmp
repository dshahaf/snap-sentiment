justin bieber time to shut up editor note dean obeidallah former attorney is political comedian and frequent commentator on various tv networks including cnn he is the editor of the politics blog the dean report and of new cnn podcast the big three that looks at the top three stories of the week follow him on twitter deanofcomedy cnn just when you think teen superstar justin bieber could possibly do anything dumber he does something that makes you do double face palm bieber is truly achieving the impossible he making lindsay lohan look good so what did bieber do this time well over the weekend he stopped at the anne frank house in amsterdam this museum is dedicated to preserving the memory of anne frank whose chronicle of her family efforts to hide from the nazis during world war ii would later become the diary of anne frank bieber ended his visit by writing in the holocaust memorial guest book truly inspiring to come here anne was great girl hopefully she would have been belieber for those who wonder what he talking about belieber is term used to describe one of bieber devoted fans apparently bieber from visiting this holocaust memorial was that he hoped that anne frank would been fan of his music he may have just redefined the word narcissistic there is silver lining to this some of his young fans tweeted that they had never heard of anne frank consequently the controversy surrounding his comments apparently raised awareness about the horrors of the holocaust to some young people previously unfamiliar with it and the anne frank house praised bieber visit it was being gracious but bieber really needs to stop talking for while and do say that as someone who harbors an inappropriate amount of dislike for the teen singer in fact last may wrote piece for defending and actually sympathizing with bieber when he had an altercation with the paparazzi but that was almost year ago since then bieber has become unbearable in the last month alone we have watched bieber caught on tape being restrained by his bodyguards as he unleashed stream of obscenities and threatened members of the paparazzi with physical violence he also allegedly spit in the face of one of his neighbors and threatened him after the neighbor complained that bieber was driving his ferrari at 100 mph in their gated community then we saw bieber storm out of his march birthday party like spoiled child calling it the worst birthday he went on to show up almost an hour late for his concert in london and in january photos surfaced of bieber smoking what the website tmz said appeared to be weed with his friend rapper lil twist get it bieber wants the world to know he is kid anymore so he has decided to go the bad ass route but bieber will never ever be the tough guy he wants to be why for starters he canadian when you think canada you think nice often overly polite people not thugs second bieber is feet inches tall and weighs 130 pounds those measurements say horse jockey not scary guy sure actor joe pesci is only feet inches tall and known as tough guy but pesci is sicilian and was born in newark new jersey not london ontario bieber is clearly heading down the path of many child stars desperate to make the transformation into star but his actions are not getting him there instead he is becoming walking punch line he has few options he could simply retire and enjoy his wealth estimates are that he is worth more than 100 million not bad for kid from canada but it unlikely that bieber will take that route the other option is to avoid the fate of past teen stars who have ended up behind bars or worse as they struggled toward adulthood instead he could follow the lead of another justin justin timberlake he too was young star first on the mickey mouse club and then in the much better known boy band sync timberlake did try to be something he not he continued to make music and then made successful transition into acting decision time is now for justin bieber he can be timberlake or cautionary tale that parents tell their kids who want to go into show business what it going to be

pick on someone your own size alright so justin bieber still has some things to figure out certainly when it comes to music but when it comes to fashion the little shroomhead painful as it is for us to admit has something going on here are 10 things the kid got on many men twice his age besides an autobiography remember what looks you were rocking at age 16 depending on the era you came of age you could fallen for rat tails jncos or even pink leather shorts it was the we not saying that the bieb is blazing trails in the fashion department we just saying that despite his obvious shortcomings his resemblance to young lesbian included the little shit knows how to pull himself together better than almost any teen on the scene right now and like it or not these chops may just secure him spot as an aught style icon so give the kid break and hear us out as we count down 10 style moves bieber has nailed
justin bieber at 19 one year year ago gq helped usher justin bieber into manhood with major profile on the occasion of his 18th birthday he was on top of the world then now let just say adult life has been so kind to jb yet the author of that gq profile reflects on the pop star he met and what different now justin was born badass that was scooter braun justin bieber manager talking to me on the phone when was writing this profile of the teen idol that appeared in gq year ago since we ran that piece bieber has had year that can be safely described as anything but badass his girlfriend selena gomez dumped him he was caught on camera threatening photographer he fainted backstage in london he had the worst 19th birthday ever his album believe sold well but did get him the kind of critical adulation and that he and his people were clearly gunning for his tour bus just got raided oh and he ruined the guestbook at the anne frank house if you thought bieber was spoiled little shit he done great deal this year to prove you correct there is every indication that bieber like many child stars is beginning to turn down darker path something that he and his people tried to convince gq could not and would not happen bieber is lab rat as braun himself told me no one ever been as famous as him as solo artist this young ever and could think of single example to prove him wrong asked my friend the college football blogger and noted cultural historian spencer hall to think of an example and he came up empty as well the last person to deal with this much fame this early he said was emperor puyi in an age when fame has already ruined so many young talents here is someone being subjected to the most fame the absolute extreme end of privilege and wealth and adoration he has 38 million insane people on twitter who will threaten to knife your tires if you speak ill of him and so it would be foolish of anyone to assume that bieber has some kind of superpower that could negate the effects something like that would have on the human mind the funny thing is think braun who clearly loves bieber really believed justin was special enough to overcome all that he wants desperately to be normal braun told me but told him you are not normal you are extraordinary there is more depth and wisdom in that kid than in most adults did really believe any of that when talked to braun but did believe that braun believed it if that makes sense bieber rarely hangs out with people his age many of his friends are much older than him and even though their affection for him seems genuine they are convinced that he is special and that he can handle anything this year that notion has been exposed as complete bullshit instead of believing that bieber could handle anything his people should have stepped back for moment said wait he just kid we have to dial this back bit but they have they pressed on with an acoustic album and tour dates and more of everything because it hard to resist when the kid is generating millions of dollars braun may love bieber but it takes rare fortitude to stop the money train and send the kid off on nols trip the people who are closest to him also depend upon him reversal of the usual figure dynamic and so everything gets warped and as bieber presses on conducting the lucrative business of being justin bieber it will get more and more warped when spent night hanging around bieber last spring it was clear immediately that he the kind of kid who loves showing you things he loved showing off his car he loved showing off the gold chain that usher gave him he loved showing off his clothes and he loved showing off his music oh how he loved showing off his music he loved bringing people into the studio cranking it up and watching everyone nod in approval hell even the songs are about showing off shit you do need to be psychiatrist to know that people like to show off their stuff when there little else to them there is much to indicate that bieber will one day develop true personality one where he does feel compelled to show people all his shiny new crap all the time it not an encouraging sign that he went to anne frank house and thought that she would admire him not the other way around braun tried to convince me that bieber was at once normal and otherworldly he was born badass and yet he about as normal as it comes he the most famous and wealthy young artist ever and yet he more aware of real life and the harshness of it than most adults you ca have it both ways at nineteen you can either be normal or you can be famous you ca be both no matter how hard you try to make it happen and if bieber and his team keep trying can guarantee you that he have an even worse birthday when he turns twenty
