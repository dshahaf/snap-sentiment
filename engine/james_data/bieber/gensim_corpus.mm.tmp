reporter 's notebook : justin bieber lifts spirits in tsunami-hit japan . you 've likely heard the idiom , `` politics makes strange bedfellows . `` in tokyo , at the u.s. ambassador 's residence , the saying came to life as teen heartthrob justin bieber , the american and canadian ambassadors to japan and nine children from the tsunami-ravaged region of japan gathered in a small room in front of the international press . the 17-year-old canadian pop star walked into the room with the children and squeezed onto a couch with them . the girls and boys , all representatives of some of the hardest-hit communities in northeastern japan , shyly peered at bieber as he made small talk with them . `` how old are you ? `` the singer asked one of the girls . `` 17 , '' she replied . `` i 'm the same age ! `` he exclaimed . bieber , well-practiced at smiling naturally as dozens of camera flashes blinded him , tried to get the tsunami victims to relax and talk through an interpreter . but the children were typically shy japanese schoolchildren . they did n't giggle or even seem all that visibly excited to be with one of the world 's biggest media sensations . they occasionally stared at the news cameras , unable to hide the awkwardness of being part of this media event . one of the public information officers at the u.s. embassy said he was n't quite sure how many of them were fans of justin bieber , a singer who is quite popular in japan , but not at the level of some of asia 's bigger pop stars . their teacher , however , was outwardly filled with glee , smiling and laughing as they all gathered for a group photo . a boy read a letter he wrote to bieber , saying thank you for sharing his time with them . the boy said he was from otsuchi , a town where half of the city was completely leveled . he bowed and looked pleased . `` things can get better and things will get better , '' bieber told the children , as cameras clicked all around him . `` there can only be good times to come from this and my prayers go out to all of your families . `` the u.s. embassy says the pop star had originally requested to perform a concert in the tsunami region , but that proved impossible , given the level of the disaster . so it helped arrange a 45-minute meet and greet in front of the media , hoping it would lift the spirits of the children in the region . but u.s. ambassador john roos also hoped it sent a message to a wider audience . `` events like justin bieber 's visit to japan not only lift the spirits of young people in japan but are an important contribution to the message to the world that japan is safe to visit and open for business , '' said roos . outside the u.s. ambassador 's residence a group that bieber was more accustomed to greeting held vigil . two dozen pre-teen girls , clutching justin bieber posters and books , screamed at each car that entered and exited out of the residence . `` we love you justin ! `` they called out , followed by high-pitched screams . a van , with heavily darkened windows , pulled out of the residence . `` that 's him , that 's him ! `` screamed a girl , who had made that same allegation at three other cars . but no matter . her friends screamed and chased the van half-way down the block , while security guards at the u.s. embassy tried to herd the girls onto the sidewalk . the guards looked frustrated , not sure how to contain the girls who scurried outside the residence like ants . it was , for sure , not a typical day at this government building .

review : justin bieber 's 'believe ' works surprisingly well . as a star birthed by youtube and raised by twitter , justin bieber has never had the luxury of growing up outside the public eye . in the two years between his breakout 2010 lp , `` my world 2.0 , '' and `` believe , '' his second proper full-length , bieber has had to go through cultural puberty and actual puberty a tough gauntlet by any measure . luckily , his instincts ( or at least the instincts of the small republic of people employed to steer the uss bieber ) are strong , and believe works surprisingly well as a reinvention and a reintroduction . it 's the rare album that tries to be everything to everyone and largely succeeds . like his mentor usher , bieber fully embraces both ibiza beats ( see dubsteppy bangers ''all around the world '' and ''take you '' ) and urban swagger ( drake and nicki minaj each drop by ) . believe also updates his signature sounds . ''catching feelings '' would have been a smooth spoonful of radio sugar on his debut , but the new bieber turns it into a soulful r & b campfire jam . biology has robbed him of some of his range , but he makes up for it in confidence : first-gen bieber could n't have handled the goosebumpy swoop of ''fall , '' but this jb turns it into the album 's profound emotional climax . it 's a prime showcase for his new voice and burgeoning mettle , proving that bieber is n't just maturing , he 's evolving . b+

justin bieber , time to shut up . editor 's note : dean obeidallah , a former attorney , is a political comedian and frequent commentator on various tv networks including cnn . he is the editor of the politics blog the dean 's report and co-host of a new cnn podcast `` the big three '' that looks at the top three stories of the week . follow him on twitter @ deanofcomedy . ( cnn ) -- just when you think teen superstar justin bieber could n't possibly do anything dumber , he does something that makes you do a double face palm . bieber is truly achieving the impossible : he 's making lindsay lohan look good . so what did bieber do this time ? well , over the weekend he stopped at the anne frank house in amsterdam . this museum is dedicated to preserving the memory of anne frank , whose chronicle of her family 's efforts to hide from the nazis during world war ii would later become `` the diary of anne frank . `` bieber ended his visit by writing in the holocaust memorial 's guest book : `` truly inspiring to come here . anne was a great girl . hopefully she would have been a belieber . `` for those who wonder what he 's talking about , a `` belieber '' is a term used to describe one of bieber 's devoted fans . apparently bieber 's take-away from visiting this holocaust memorial was that he hoped that anne frank would 've been a fan of his music . he may have just redefined the word `` narcissistic . `` there is a silver lining to this . some of his young fans tweeted that they had never heard of anne frank . consequently , the controversy surrounding his comments apparently raised awareness about the horrors of the holocaust to some young people previously unfamiliar with it . and the anne frank house praised bieber 's visit . it was being gracious . but bieber really needs to stop talking for a while . and i do n't say that as someone who harbors an inappropriate amount of dislike for the teen singer . in fact , last may i wrote a piece for cnn.com defending and actually sympathizing with bieber when he had an altercation with the paparazzi . but that was almost a year ago . since then , bieber has become unbearable . in the last month alone , we have watched bieber caught on tape being restrained by his bodyguards as he unleashed a stream of obscenities and threatened members of the paparazzi with physical violence . he also allegedly spit in the face of one of his neighbors and threatened him after the neighbor complained that bieber was driving his ferrari at 100 mph in their gated community . then we saw bieber storm out of his march birthday party like a spoiled child calling it the `` worst birthday . `` he went on to show up almost an hour late for his concert in london . and in january , photos surfaced of bieber smoking what the website tmz said appeared to be weed with his friend rapper , lil twist . i get it . bieber wants the world to know he is n't a kid anymore . so he has decided to go the `` bad ass '' route . but bieber will never , ever be the tough guy he wants to be . why ? for starters , he 's canadian . when you think canada , you think nice , often overly polite people -- not thugs . second , bieber is 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighs 130 pounds . those measurements say `` horse jockey , '' not scary guy . ( sure , actor joe pesci is only 5 feet 4 inches tall and known as a tough guy , but pesci is sicilian and was born in newark , new jersey , not london , ontario . ) bieber is clearly heading down the path of many child stars desperate to make the transformation into grown-up star . but his actions are not getting him there . instead , he is becoming a walking punch line . he has a few options . he could simply retire and enjoy his wealth . estimates are that he is worth more than $ 100 million . not bad for a 19-year-old kid -- from canada . but it 's unlikely that bieber will take that route . the other option is to avoid the fate of past teen stars who have ended up behind bars or worse as they struggled toward adulthood . instead , he could follow the lead of another justin : justin timberlake . he , too , was a young star . first on `` the mickey mouse club '' and then in the much better known boy band 'n sync . timberlake did n't try to be something he 's not . he continued to make music and then made a successful transition into acting . decision time is now for justin bieber : he can be a timberlake or a cautionary tale that parents tell their kids who want to go into show business . what 's it going to be ?

' and i think that 's the biggest problem , especially with teen idols , you immediately go from learning about puberty , to having hundreds of employees , and not really knowing how to deal with that . `` during a record-setting seven year existence , bass and 'n sync sold more than 50 million albums , and excited fans across the world . as the guest notes , that type of success brings about a unique set of challenges : `` with fame comes entitlement . you have tons of people around you saying 'yes sir , yes sir , yes sir . ' so ' it 's hard to keep that ego in check , '' he tells piers morgan . `` he 's [ bieber ] sought after all over the world , and that can get to you . that 's got to affect someone at that age . `` watch the clip , and listen to the exchange , then tune in at 9 as bass goes on to detail some of the specific issues that arise when young people garner the type of attention currently being paid to justin bieber .
pick on someone your own size . alright , so justin bieber still has some things to figure out . certainly when it comes to music . but when it comes to fashion , the little shroomhead painful as it is for us to admit has something going on . here are 10 things the kid 's got on many men twice his age besides an autobiography remember what looks you were rocking at age 16 ? depending on the era you came of age , you could 've fallen for rat tails , jncos , or even pink leather shorts ( it was the '80s ! ) . we 're not saying that the bieb is blazing trails in the fashion department . we 're just saying that despite his obvious shortcomings his well-documented resemblance to a young lesbian included the little shit knows how to pull himself together better than almost any teen on the scene right now . and , like it or not , these chops may just secure him a spot as an aught 's style icon . so , give the kid a break and hear us out as we count down 10 style moves bieber has nailed .
justin bieber at 19 : one year post-gq . a year ago , gq helped usher justin bieber into manhood with a major profile on the occasion of his 18th birthday . he was on top of the world then . now ? let 's just say adult life has n't been so kind to jb yet . the author of that gq profile reflects on the pop star he met , and what 's different now . `` justin was born a badass . `` that was scooter braun , justin bieber 's manager , talking to me on the phone when i was writing this profile of the teen idol that appeared in gq a year ago . since we ran that piece , bieber has had a year that can be safely described as anything but badass . his girlfriend , selena gomez , dumped him . he was caught on camera threatening a photographer . he fainted backstage in london . he had the worst 19th birthday ever . his album , believe , sold well but did n't get him the kind of critical adulation and ascension-to-timberlake-status that he and his people were clearly gunning for . his tour bus just got raided . oh , and he ruined the guestbook at the anne frank house . if you thought bieber was a spoiled little shit , he 's done a great deal this year to prove you correct . there is every indication that bieber , like many child stars , is beginning to turn down a darker path , something that he and his people tried to convince gq could not and would not happen . bieber is a lab rat . as braun himself told me , `` no one 's ever been as famous as him as a solo artist this young ... ever , '' and i could n't think of a single example to prove him wrong . i asked my friend , the college football blogger and noted cultural historian spencer hall , to think of an example and he came up empty as well . `` the last person to deal with this much fame this early , '' he said , `` was emperor puyi . `` in an age when fame has already ruined so many young talents , here is someone being subjected to the most fame ... the absolute extreme end of privilege and wealth and adoration . he has 38 million insane people on twitter who will threaten to knife your tires if you speak ill of him . and so it would be foolish of anyone to assume that bieber has some kind of superpower that could negate the effects something like that would have on the human mind . the funny thing is , i think braun who clearly loves bieber really believed justin was special enough to overcome all that . `` he wants desperately to be normal , '' braun told me , `` but i told him , 'justin , you are not normal , you are extraordinary ' ... there is more depth and wisdom in that kid than in most adults . `` i did n't really believe any of that when i talked to braun , but i did believe that braun believed it , if that makes sense . bieber rarely hangs out with people his age . many of his friends are much older than him , and even though their affection for him seems genuine , they are convinced that he is special and that he can handle anything . this year , that notion has been exposed as complete bullshit . instead of believing that bieber could handle anything , his people should have stepped back for a moment said , `` wait , he 's just a kid . we have to dial this back a bit . `` but they have n't . they 've pressed on with an acoustic album and tour dates and more of everything , because it 's hard to resist when the kid is generating millions of dollars . braun may love bieber , but it takes rare fortitude to stop the money train and send the kid off on a nols trip . the people who are closest to him also depend upon him a reversal of the usual child/parental figure dynamic and so everything gets warped . and as bieber presses on conducting the lucrative business of being justin bieber , it will get more and more warped . when i spent a night hanging around bieber last spring , it was clear immediately that he 's the kind of kid who loves showing you things . he loved showing off his car . he loved showing off the gold chain that usher gave him . he loved showing off his clothes . and he loved showing off his music . oh , how he loved showing off his music . he loved bringing people into the studio , cranking it up , and watching everyone nod in approval . hell , even the songs are about showing off shit ... you do n't need to be a psychiatrist to know that people like to show off their stuff when there 's little else to them . there is n't much to indicate that bieber will one day develop a true personality , one where he does n't feel compelled to show people all his shiny new crap all the time . it 's not an encouraging sign that he went to anne frank 's house and thought that she would admire him , not the other way around . braun tried to convince me that bieber was at once normal and otherworldly . he was born a badass and yet he 's , `` about as normal as it comes . `` he 's the most famous and wealthy young artist ever and yet , `` he 's more aware of real life and the harshness of it than most adults . `` you ca n't have it both ways . at nineteen , you can either be normal , or you can be famous . you ca n't be both , no matter how hard you try to make it happen . and if bieber and his team keep trying , i can guarantee you that he 'll have an even worse birthday when he turns twenty .
justin bieber : pot smoker . justin drew bieber is a pot smoker . it 's official . the innocence of the canadian disappeared the second the photographs of bieber smoking what is 100 percent a blunt were posted to tmz . and while most of the press is up in arms about bieber 's herbal appreciation , there is no reason to be upset . these kinds of things happen . teenagers when they 're not busy being the worst people ever smoke pot , even multi-millionaire ones with fantastic hair . now that bieber is a known toker , there really is only one thing left to contemplate : just what kind of pot smoker is he ? below are some common types to consider : the lunchbox . the lunchbox does one thing and one thing only : lunches . this kind of pot smoker never , ever , stops laughing . want to have an in-depth discussion on the cultural implications of the inevitable collapse of small-town newspapers ? too bad , because the lunchbox is lunching . want to just share your theory that quantum leap was doomed the second its writers decided `` uh , make sam a woman ! `` was a suitable plot point ? the lunchbox ca n't because he is on the floor laughing while saying `` bakula '' over and over again . this kind of smoker is typically inexperienced , so there 's a high ( lunchboxes reading this are dying at that pun ) probability bieber falls into this category . the tweaker . ca n't find the tweaker after you 're done burning one ? check the windows . the tweaker is definitely peeking out through the blinds . this kind of pot smoker is extremely paranoid and rightfully so ; the tweaker has been arrested at least once for possession . the tweaker will ironically yell `` be cool ! `` at people and can be found pacing back and forth and ruining everyone 's good time . given that bieber is a huge celebrity and therefore worried about his image , there 's a 50/50 chance he 's a tweaker . the zombie . the zombie is difficult to describe because this kind of pot smoker never actually speaks . it does n't matter what is happening around him or her , the zombie is zoned the fuck out . the zombie also no matter time of day it is has bedhead , and is 94.6-percent likely to be wearing a lcd soundsystem t-shirt . bieber would never allow his hair to be anything less than perfect , so there 's almost no shot he 's the zombie . the snake . the snake is always smoking pot with you despite never being invited to smoke pot with you . you 're about to turn and pass the bong to your friend , and bam ! there 's the snake , intercepting it with a smile . because the snake is so sneaky , it 's often difficult to tell him apart from other pot smokers , so here 's a tip : ask the person in question to display a form of currency that does n't have pocket lint attached to it . if the person pulls a clean bill out , they are not the snake . bieber is a young man with excessive amounts of money and millions of adoring fans . he does n't need to be shady about smoking . but then again , he has zero people to tell him not to be that way . bieber the snake ? never say never .
germany asks justin bieber to pay costs of caring for his monkey . german authorities have asked pop star justin bieber to hand over nearly $ 8,000 for the costs of caring for the capuchin monkey he left behind in munich after bringing it on tour without the right paperwork . the bill covers the cost of vaccinations , accommodation and transport for the monkey , known as mally , which is now being cared for at a zoo in northern germany . customs officials posted a public notice of the bill after failing to get a response from bieber at the address he gave to customs officials , said martin brandlhuber , a customs spokesman at munich 's airport . in light of that , german authorities have followed the applicable laws and made the claim publicly known , he said . bieber must pay up the next time he comes to germany or risk being denied entry , brandlhuber said . if he is unable to pay cash , then customs officials could confiscate other property to meet the claim , brandlhuber said . alternatively , bieber could be denied entry and be required to provide a valid address . the young monkey was taken to a munich animal shelter after it was confiscated at the end of march as bieber arrived in germany on a european tour . mally was transferred to the serengeti park in hodenhagen , near hanover , in june after spending several weeks in quarantine . bieber had until may 7 to present the paperwork to reclaim his pet but failed to do so , zoo spokeswoman juliane gunkel said last month . as a result , mally is now the property of the german government , and the serengeti park is acting as the caretaker . the park was picked because it is the only zoo in germany that has a family of capuchins for mally to join . bieber 's representatives declined to comment at the time the animal was confiscated .

man up , bieber . justin bieber is now 18 years old . which means , technically , he 's an adult . but the question remains : is he a man ? ( if you just laughed , congratulations : you 're mean . ) gq sent drew magary to spend one wild night with the beeb in los angeles right after his big birthday , with explicit orders not to come back until we knew the answer i have been told specifically that i will be able to punch justin bieber in the face . it is mid-march , and i am standing on the patio outside conway studios in hollywood , where bieber is recording his new album , and i have been waiting for him for hours . fifty-one hours , to be precise , at least if we 're counting the two times that our meeting has been postponed so far . this time , however , i have been assured that bieber is really coming , and that he wants to fight me . he 's due to arrive at any minute now , which is good , because i ca n't wait to draw some canadian teenybopper blood . justin bieber is now 18 years old . and when you 're a teen superstar who has just turned 18 , there are really only two options for where you can go next : you can mature into a `` real '' artist , or you can swan-dive straight onto the pop-cultural scrap heap with all the other reality stars and drug addicts . a small cottage industry has been erected around bieber to make sure he does n't choose door no . 2 , and so the rebranding of a more grown-up justin bieber has begun . there 's the new album , out this month , called believe , which is stacked with ready-made dance-floor singles . there 's a new haircut ( no more stupid bangs ) . and then there 's me . to commemorate the birth of bieber 2.0 , gq asked me to fly out to los angeles and make a man out of him . never mind that bieber has already made more money and been offered a finer selection of quality tail than you or i ever will . the goal was explicit : get bieber to experience some kind of rite of manhood . to that end , we proposed to his people any number of insane ideas : drinking , smoking , drinking , going to a titty bar , gambling , drinking , shooting things , drinking , etc . we assumed most of them would be rejected but that perhaps one might slip through the cracks , hopefully the drinking . i told everyone i knew that i had been handed the precious mission of turning justin bieber into a gin-swilling , donkey-punching man of the world . my wife : `` you 're meeting justin bieber ? `` my mom : `` that 's the kid with the hair , right ? `` my kid : `` you 're meeting justin beaver ? `` damn straight i was . and when i was done with him , he would be justin beaver : teenybopper turned porn-star assassin . of course , none of this ended up coming to pass . turns out neither bieber nor his team were all that interested in any of our manly ideas . in fact , it 's a measure of just how carefully managed bieber is that all of our ideas , even having a simple beer , were treated as impossibilities , like proposing to build a gay disco in iran . a second round of gentler ideas ( let 's race go-karts ! ) was also rejected , to the point where i was willing to settle for just seeing bieber in person , to confirm that he actually existed . his people finally blessed a basic , nothing-on-the-agenda meeting on a monday night , only to cancel it while i was midair on my way to los angeles . on tuesday , i was told that i could meet him at his recording studio and then we 'd hash out whatever manly activity was left for us once we ruled out anything fun . i got there at 8 p.m. and was told by bieber 's pr lady that justin was in the studio but was about to go to dinner with his mom and i 'd have to wait till he got back . `` so he 's here now ? `` i asked . `` yes , '' she said . `` can i see him ? `` `` no . `` `` can i go to dinner with him and his mom ? i 'll eat light . `` `` no . he 'll be back in an hour . `` to keep me occupied , i was escorted into the studio , where kuk harrell , bieber 's vocal producer , was working on believe without him . harrell is an incredibly nice man who looks like a black version of johnny depp 's willy wonka , so i was happy to sit around and stare at his hair for a while . after a few minutes , i noticed that someone had drawn a bunch of dicks all over the grease board by the door . so i pointed at them and asked , `` hey , who drew all the dicks ? `` one of the sound engineers immediately jumped up , ran over , and erased them with his sleeve . this is the new and mature bieber . we ca n't have dicks being drawn all over the place . people might get the wrong idea about filthy-rich 18-year-old pop stars . at eight forty , the pr lady came in to tell me surprise ! bieber would not be returning tonight . finally , after i sat in my hotel room for another day and ran through as many imaginary conversations with the beeb as any of his 12-year-old fangirls , word came down from the mountaintop : i would meet bieber at his studio at 6 p.m. that night and we would box . given all of our suggestions that had been rejected , this made no sense . well , we ca n't have justin openly buying pornography why do n't we just endanger his singing voice and orbital bone structure instead ? but only a fool would argue . if someone asks you if you 'd like to punch justin bieber in the face , the answer is yes . now i 'm back at the studio , ready to fight . bieber is running late , i am told , because he 's procuring the boxing equipment . the pr lady , melissa , warns me that bieber boxes regularly and that his father , jeremy , is a former mma fighter . now i 'm starting to get a little worried . i 've been waiting two and a half days , and i was looking forward to teaching this kid a lesson about punctuality . but for the first time , it 's dawning on me that justin bieber might be able to kick my ass . what if his horny teenager strength can easily overpower my dad strength ? what if he knocks me out ? what if he puts me in the hospital ? what if he kills me ? do i still get paid for this ? read more http : //www.gq.com/entertainment/celebrities/201206/justin-bieber-gq-june-2012-interview # ixzz2idfjcgvc

swedish police : small amount of drugs taken from bieber 's bus . swedish police found illegal narcotics on justin bieber 's tour bus as it was parked outside stockholm 's globe arena , where he was performing , a police spokesman said thursday . while a source close to bieber insisted it was a non-story and no charges were filed , it is the latest stumble in the teen pop star 's european tour . bieber 's publicist had no official comment when contacted by cnn . police found a small amount of unspecified illegal narcotics on the tour bus that bieber and about nine others had taken to the arena for the concert wednesday night , stockholm police spokesman varg gyllander said . authorities searched the bus at the arena after a police officer smelled marijuana near the vehicle when it was outside a stockholm hotel , gyllander said . the bieber team had left the bus before police searched it . the case is under investigation , but no arrests were made and no charges have been filed , gyllander said . for a charge of possession of narcotics , police must find the drug on the offender , he said . the stockholm concert proceeded as scheduled . bieber 's next concert is on sunday in st. petersburg , russia . earlier this month , bieber drew criticism for a remark he left in the guest book of the anne frank house in amsterdam , netherlands . he suggested that frank , the teenage diarist who died in a nazi concentration camp in 1945 , would have been a fan of his . critics accused him of being narcissistic , but others , including frank 's stepsister , criticized the uproar and said frank might indeed have been a fan . and last month in munich , german authorities confiscated a young monkey that bieber traveled with .
