McCain: "No real way to achieve" diplomatic deal on chemical weapons; some GOP resisting Pres. Obama "because they dislike" him.
Senator John McCain (R-AZ) told “New Day” Anchors Chris Cuomo and Kate Bolduan that “there’s no real way to achieve” the diplomatic solution in Syria, America needs to “step up assistance to Free Syrian Army” to get a negotiated departure of Bashar al-Assad and there are some Republicans who are resisting President Obama’s plan “because they dislike” him. On budget and debt ceiling negotiations, Senator McCain urged the President to negotiate and for his colleagues to not shut down the government.
On a diplomatic deal, Senator McCain said, “I think what they are pursuing is a laudable goal, but there’s no real way to achieve it, number one. Number two is that you now give Putin a major place in this whole scenario and in the Middle East.”
“Until you reverse the momentum on the battle field, and Bashar al-Assad thinks he’s going to lose, is the only way you get a negotiated departure of Bashar al-Assad,” Senator McCain said. “As long as he thinks he’s winning, particularly with the assistance that he’s getting from the Russians and the Iranians. As we speak today, there will be a plane load of arms, conventional weapons, landing from Moscow to be used to kill Syrians. At the same time, we are dismantling the chemical weapons stocks. That’s crazy.”
