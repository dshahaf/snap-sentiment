Sen. Menendez on Syria: I take this obligation very seriously.
Senator Robert Menedez (D-NJ), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, appeared on “New Day” to talk about the committee’s resolution on Syria. When Cuomo asked why he wants to move forward with military action if polls show that most Americans are not on board, Senator Menendez said that he takes “this obligation” seriously and the U.S. needs to “send a message to global actors.”
“I take this obligation… very seriously. As I said, I voted against the war in Iraq when the vote for the war was popular…. I have voted and advocated a quicker withdrawal in Afghanistan,” Senator Menendez said. “I believe, that in this instance, not only is the punishment for the use of weapons of mass destruction via chemical weapons in violation of international law and needs a targeted military response, but also we send a message to the Ayatollah in Iran, do not march toward those nuclear weapons you’re trying to acquire. We send a message to the dictator of North Korea – we’re serious about protecting South Korea and the Korean Peninsula. And we send a message to global actors. That is in our national security.”
