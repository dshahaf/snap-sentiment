Kanye's dream collaboration? Bieber.
After catching a severe case of Bieber Fever over the weekend, Kanye West plans to remedy the situation by collaborating with the teen singing sensation.

"Listening to @Justin Bieber "Run Away love" ... I love Sunday mornings in the crib," tweeted West,who said he'd played the song about 10 times that morning.

Flattered, Bieber replied to the hip-hop superstar, "it's not a so what moment for me. I'm 16 and a fan. I'm kinda hyped u are listening to my stuff. Thank u. Nice sunday morning."


Their love-fest didn't end there, however.

West, gushing like a true Belieber, wrote back, "So bugged out me and @JustinBieber are tweeting at the same time... Social networking is pretty awesome." He then proposed that he and the teen pop star get together for a collaboration, along with legendary rapper Raekwon.

"Yo Ghost and Rae were on one of my favorite Jodeci remixes of all time.. maybe me and Rae should hop on Runaway Love," West tweeted.

It appears that he's already started working on his vocals â€“  just in case. After revealing that he had been dancing around his house to Bieber's hit, wondering, "Will your Itunes break if you play a song to many times????????!!!!!!!!!!! Runaway Loooooooooooooove!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" he confessed that he had also taken a stab at singing the song.

"I just tried to sing the first notes of Runaway Love and when my voice cracked, had to remember I don't sing that good," West tweeted. "GODBLESSAUTOTUNE."
